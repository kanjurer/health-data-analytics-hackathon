    "title": "How ‘revenge of the Covid contrarians’ unleashed by RFK Jr puts broader vaccine advances at risk",
    "text": "The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, entered office with a pledge to tackle the US’s chronic disease epidemic and give infectious disease a “break”. In at least one of those goals, Kennedy has been expeditious.\n\nExperts said as Kennedy makes major cuts in public health in his first weeks in office, the infrastructure built to mitigate Covid-19 has become a clear target – an aim that has the dual effect of weakening immunization efforts as the US endures the largest measles outbreak since 2000.\n\n“If his goal is to undermine public health infrastructure, he’s making strides there,” said Dorit Reiss, a University of California Law School professor whose research focuses on vaccine law. “If his goal is combating chronic diseases – he’s not doing very well.”\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been characterized by upheaval since Kennedy and the billionaire Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) cumulatively axed 20,000 jobs – roughly a quarter of the 82,000-person workforce.\n\nAnd it appears that turmoil will continue: a leaked budget memo shows the administration poised to propose a budget cut of another $40bn, or roughly one-third of the department’s discretionary spending.\n\nAmid the cuts, attacks on Covid-19 infrastructure have proven thematic, and show the administration’s hostility toward work that once mitigated the virus. That’s included attacking promising vaccine platforms and elevating once-ostracized voices to high-level roles.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” a spokesperson for HHS told the Guardian in response to questions about its strategy.\n\n“HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”\n\nGregg Gonsalves, a Yale University associate professor and infectious disease epidemiologist, calls this strategy the “revenge of the Covid contrarians”.\n\n“They’re not interested in the science, they’re interested in their conclusions and having the science bend to their will,” said Gonsalves. “They want to create a Potemkin village of their own making that looks like science but has nothing to do with science at all.”\n\nAmong Kennedy’s changes: attacks on the promising platform that supported Covid-19 vaccine development, delayed approval of a Covid-19 vaccine, the clawing back of grants that provided local immunization support and studied vaccine safety, and elevating one-time critics of Covid-19 policy.\n\n“When the new administration came in, we were hearing even within the organization: ‘We can’t say Covid, we’re not allowed to say Covid,’” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (Naccho), about her members’ conversations.\n\nFreeman noted that “we kind of saw the writing on the wall a couple months ago that: ‘OK, they really don’t want anything Covid-related to be pursued any more.’ Everything Covid-related is quite honestly at risk.”\n\nIn the latest change, Kennedy said this week he may remove Covid-19 shots from the childhood vaccine schedule, which would probably make the shots harder to get by limiting insurance coverage.\n\n“The recommendation for children was always dubious,” Kennedy told Fox News. Although a minority of children are vaccinated, the shots are recommended, especially for immune-compromised children.\n\nFreeman believes the desire to erase the government’s Covid legacy led to HHS’s decision to claw back $11bn in public health funds from states and localities. In effect done overnight, the clawback gave local officials only hours to lay off workers, cancel immunization clinics and even stop construction projects.\n\n“That’s why we feel like the drawback of the funding occurred: Covid,” said Freeman.\n\nA spokesperson for HHS characterized this as a savings, and said most canceled awards were for Covid-19-related work.\n\nThe pullback led to the cancellation of more than 50 measles immunization clinics in Texas, where the measles outbreak has already claimed the lives of two unvaccinated children, to pilot programs such as “Text4Vax”, which sent reminders about pediatric vaccines to parents.\n\nAmong the canceled grants were also programs that would seem to align with Kennedy’s rhetoric about vaccine safety – among them, a study of the safety and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant women in California and global Covid-19 vaccine safety monitoring in New Zealand.\n\n“If you start to take away people from health departments – the immunizers, the educators, the clinicians – through some of these other funding cuts , it disables the program naturally,” said Freeman. “You can’t put as many shots in arms.”\n\nLarger cancelled grants included a $2.25bn grant program to reduce Covid-19’s impact on the people worst affected, which had been sent to states and localities from South Dakota to Florida and the Virgin Islands to Vermont.\n\nUnder Kennedy’s watch, HHS has also taken the unusual step of delaying an expected vaccine approval, reportedly under the watch of a Kennedy political appointee.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which sits under the umbrella of HHS, delayed the expected 1 April approval of the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine. Novavax confirmed to the Guardian that its application remained on hold, and said it would have “no further comments”.\n\nReiss said she doesn’t think “any vaccine that’s in the pipeline is going to go forward under Kennedy” or that “he will let any vaccine go far now”.\n\nDr Tracy Hoeg, a political appointee, was reportedly involved in the decision. Hoeg also appeared as the FDA’s representative at a special advisory committee on immunizations in April, where she took the opportunity to question the efficacy of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson told the Guardian: “The FDA’s independent review process for the Novavax vaccine, like all vaccines, is based solely on ensuring safety and efficacy, not political considerations. Any delays are a result of scientific review, not a lack of priority. It’s important to focus on the facts rather than unfounded speculation.”\n\nScientists have also said they fear for the future of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology – the platform that underpinned the fast development of Covid-19 vaccines and that held promise for treating and preventing a wide range of diseases.\n\nHoeg served on Florida’s public health integrity committee, which served as a platform for Covid-19 criticism during the pandemic. At the time, it was chaired by the Florida surgeon general, Dr Joseph Ladapo, who has also sown doubt about the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines.\n\nHoeg could be further buttressed by insiders such as Dr Matthew Memoli, who, Kennedy said, “is going to be running Niaid [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]”. Memoli, whom Kennedy described as “the top flu researcher at NIH”, is known for opposition to Covid-19 vaccine mandates and declined to be vaccinated. In March, Memoli sent an email to NIH grant officials requiring any grant applications that reference mRNA technology to be reported to Kennedy’s office. He also canceled government-backed studies on vaccine hesitancy.\n\nThe nominee for HHS general counsel, Michael B Stuart, is also well-known for involvement in vaccine fights. Stuart, a former West Virginia lawmaker, in 2023 proposed a bill to exempt virtual public school students from vaccine requirements and allow private schools to set their own requirements, according to Stat.\n\n“Dismantling the sort of vaccine infrastructure this country relies upon – that’s been in place for several dozens and dozens of years – only impacts the chronic disease front he’s trying to ameliorate as well,” said James Hodge, a professor of law at Arizona State University and a health law expert who said he worries about the future of vaccine advisory committees. “Acquiring infectious diseases leads to chronic conditions later.”\n\nStill, some of Kennedy’s most ardent supporters and reported informal advisers, such as the former cardiologist Peter McCullough, have argued these actions don’t go far enough.\n\n“The big threat is that we still have Covid-19 vaccines on the market,” McCullough told KFF Health News. “It’s horrendous. I would not hesitate – I would just pull it. What’s he waiting for?” McCullough did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.",

    "title": "RFK Jr.’s Sister: ‘He Is Not an Appropriate HHS Secretary’",
    "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s sister Kerry Kennedy agrees with John Oliver that her anti-vaccine brother isn’t fit to oversee the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nSunday’s episode of Oliver’s Last Week Tonight went viral after the late-night host and comedian dedicated more than 35 minutes to making the case against President Donald Trump’s secretary of health and human services.\n\n“RFK needs to go, and by impeachment if necessary,” he said. “Too much damage has already been done. This is a man who is clearly in way over his worm-riddled head. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, he doesn’t know who he’s fired… and if that’s wasn’t bad enough he’s currently spreading dangerous nonsense and gutting life-saving research.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAsked by CNN’s Erin Burnett if she agreed with Oliver that her brother should be impeached, Kerry Kennedy said, “I think he is not an appropriate HHS secretary.”\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr. has fired or forced out some of the nation's top scientists at the Department of Health and Human Services. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nThe human-rights lawyer was speaking from El Salvador, where she has been trying unsuccessfully to meet with 10 Venezuelan men she’s representing after Trump administration officials sent them to the notorious CECOT mega prison without any warning.\n\n“I love Bobby and I find him incredibly charismatic. But I have said—and my other family members have been super clear about this—that we disagree again and again and again on the things that he’s said,” she added.\n\nKennedy’s short tenure has already been marred by numerous scandals.\n\nDuring his segment, Oliver shouted, “F--- you!” at an image of Kennedy, after showing a video of the secretary calling autism an “epidemic” that is worse than COVID-19, which killed millions of people.\n\n“These are kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date, many of them will never use a toilet unassisted,” Kennedy said earlier this month, despite the fact that autism is a spectrum and many people with autism manage to do all of those things.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.—pictured here at his swearing-in with President Trump and Kennedy's wife Cheryl Hines—suspended his third-party presidential run last summer and endorsed Donald Trump in exchange for a cabinet position if Trump won. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nAfter his comments sparked a major backlash, he claimed he was talking about children with “profound autism.”\n\nIn the meantime, vaccine hesitancy—which Kennedy has long encouraged—has led to a deadly nationwide measles outbreak. Kennedy has been reluctant to advise people to get the MMR vaccine, and has claimed it’s better for everyone to get measles and develop natural immunity—even though the disease can cause permanent brain damage in children.\n\nTop officials at the Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health have quit, citing censorship, “misinformation and lies,” and interference with their research. Stunned FDA staff have been subjected to Kennedy’s tirades about the “deep state,” and accusations that they are shills for the industries they regulate.\n\nKennedy has said that instead of getting the MMR vaccine, children should catch measles and develop natural immunity—even though the disease can lead to death or permanent brain damage in children. Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images\n\nIn addition, about 10,000 HHS employees have been fired, gutting key public health offices and purging prominent senior scientists. Thanks to mistakes made by Elon Musk’s government cost-cutting initiative DOGE, some of those people were rehired, but most were let go permanently.\n\nThat’s on top of countless scientists and academics whose funding has been cut, positions eliminated, and research halted after the NIH terminated grants worth millions of dollars.\n\nDuring Monday’s interview, Kerry Kennedy ran through a list of prejudices and conspiracy theories her brother has promoted: That people shouldn’t get vaccinated; that HIV does not cause AIDS; that people are transgender because of pollutants in the water; that autistic people are a burden on society.\n\n“This is insanity. Just look at the science,” she said. “This goes on and on and on. I love my brother. [But] I think he’s dead wrong.”",

    "title": "How the Anti-Vax Movement Is Taking Over the Right",
    "text": "Lee Haywood got the COVID-19 vaccine. He’s seen friends lose their lives to the virus, and watched others struggle to recover. A smoker for 37 years, he believes the medical evidence showing that the vaccine sharply reduces his chances of a severe infection.\n\nYet on the frigid afternoon of Jan. 23, Haywood, a 61-year-old Republican running for a North Carolina congressional seat, was near the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, standing among signs that read “Vaccines kill” and “Stop the Vaccine Holocaust.” He had helped organize a bus carrying 35 people from Greensboro to the capital.\n\n“I’m against the forced vaccinations or forced wearing of these masks by these bureaucrats deep in the bowels of the government,” Haywood says. “This country was founded on liberty, and these mandates just slap everybody in the face.”\n\nHaywood’s presence at the “Defeat the Mandates” rally was a window into a growing political cause that is beginning to unite a host of groups across the right. The anti-vaccine movement, once a fringe cohort, has repositioned itself as an opposition to mandates and government overreach. The distinction has attracted legions of supporters by tapping into the anger, exhaustion, grief and frustration of millions of Americans as the pandemic enters its third year.\n\n“Some people will try to paint it as an anti-vax movement, but it’s an anti-mandate movement,” Kevin Ryan, who identified himself as a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, said on a planning call Jan. 18. “If they understand that about us, we can attract a lot of people to our cause.”\n\nStickers lay on the ground at the Defeat the Mandates rally on Jan. 23, 2022. Bryan Olin Dozier—Reuters\n\nThe D.C. demonstration suggested Ryan was right. The spectacle was part Trump rally, part conspiracy convention, part protest. Groups of teachers and nurses mingled with firefighters and church groups. The yellow Gadsden flags adopted by the Tea Party a decade ago mixed with Trump 2020 placards, “Stop the Steal” signs and “F— Joe Biden” flags. A group of men wearing the insignia of the far-right Proud Boys lingered on the edges of the crowd, near a group of women wearing flower crowns and flashing peace signs as they took selfies with a “Mama Bears Against Mandates” board.\n\nOn stage, a host of anti-vaccine celebrities, from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to right-wing doctors promoting alternative COVID-19 treatments, compared U.S. vaccination policies to Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Doctors in white coats falsely claimed that vaccines are “not working” and advocated for unproven treatments.\n\nRead More: How America’s Frontline Doctors Sold Access to Bogus COVID-19 Treatments.\n\nIn the crowd, right-wing conspiracy theorists and vaccine skeptics mingled with libertarians, critics of “Big Pharma” and conservative politicians like Haywood. Fresh anger mixed with repackaged old grievances. Only a handful of the three-dozen rally-goers who spoke to TIME said their anti-vaccine stance predated COVID-19, but it was clear that it had become a defining marker of their political identity. Most cast their attendance as a fight against something larger—a way to channel their frustration with the government response to the pandemic, or an outlet for leftover resentment from the 2020 election. All of them said it would be their top priority when they next go to the polls.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr. speaks at the Defeat the Mandates rally in Washington. Bryan Olin Dozier—Reuters\n\n“There’s no going back now,” says Addie Johnson, 43, who drove in from Virginia and says she has lost friends and family relationships over her anti-vaccination stance in the past year. “You’re either with this movement or against it.”\n\nAlready, opposition to vaccine and mask mandates has become a purity test for Republican officials, as well as a key part of their agenda ahead of this year’s midterm elections. It seems to have turned some of former President Donald Trump’s fervent supporters against him in favor of politicians like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has been coy about acknowledging his vaccination status and is not publicly backing such measures. Just 26% of Republicans say they consider vaccine mandates acceptable, according to a CNN poll last month, compared to 82% of Democrats. This partisan divide is evident in the vaccination data itself: unvaccinated adults are three times more likely to lean Republican than Democrat, according to a November analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nExperts warn that the growing power of the joint anti-vaccine and anti-mandate movement could also provide cover to darker forces of anti-government sentiment. Organizers of the rally cast the event in the tradition of the 1960s civil rights movement, complete with hippie peace signs and tambourines. Yet the calls to action included some disturbing warning notes. In the context of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and rising threats to public officials, the exhortations to “reclaim our country” and “refuse to comply” carried the implication of violence on the horizon. Some speakers threatened the press and Dr. Anthony Fauci, invoking the Nuremberg trials of leading Nazis. Leaning against a tree, a woman in a pink headband and sunglasses held a sign declaring in bold black and red letters: “Shoot those who try to kidnap and vaccinate your child.”\n\nAnti-vaccination activists participate in a rally after a Defeat The Mandates march at the Lincoln Memorial. Alex Wong—Getty Images\n\nThe coordination in the days before the rally illustrated the reach of the anti-mandate message. The event was promoted on Joe Rogan’s podcast, the most popular show on Spotify, as well as former Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. Calls between organizers and attendees on the social audio app Clubhouse often stretched on several hours. Supporters, many of whom couldn’t attend the rally or don’t live in the U.S., shared information on Facebook and Telegram, offered to pay for one another’s bus tickets to Washington, and swapped advice on which restaurants and hotels wouldn’t require proof of vaccination. “IF YOU MISS THIS EVENT it will be like telling your grandkids YOU MISSED WOODSTOCK,” tweeted Del Bigtree, a TV producer who founded the anti-vaccine group Informed Consent Action Network and helped organize the rally.\n\nThe growing U.S. anti-vaccine movement is part of a global effort. The rally in Washington featured speakers from Israel and the U.K., and frequently referenced lockdown measures and mandates abroad. Photos and videos of the event were widely shared in large international anti-vaccine and far-right Telegram groups. The “Defeat the Mandates” rally was scheduled to coincide with global anti-vaccine protests organized by a far-right German group, under the banner “World Wide Rally for Freedom.” These events have often led to violence, including on Jan. 23, when protestors in Brussels clashed with police.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter.\n\nPlanning calls for the D.C. demonstration reflected how the anti-mandate rallying cry, like other right-wing movements, has crossed borders in recent years. “I have cousins in Australia, and they’re waiting for the U.S. to have something huge like this,” one woman said on a Jan. 21 planning call ahead of the Washington rally. “People in other countries have been marching by the hundreds of thousands, and it’s really time for us to stand with them,” another man said.\n\nSimilar rallies like the one in Washington were scheduled at some state capitols across the country. Many seemed to be driven by the same narratives that pulled thousands of Americans into the QAnon conspiracy, with slogans like “Save the Children”— only this time, it was on behalf of groups with names like the Children’s Health Defense Fund, the political wing of Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccine organization, which falsely contends that thousands of children are being injured by vaccines.\n\nRead More: QAnon Candidates Are Winning Local Elections. Can They Be Stopped?\n\nThe overarching goal is “to create a populist movement through the propagation of disinformation and to undermine well-respected American institutions,” says Nick Sawyer, an emergency-room physician who runs the group No License for Disinformation, which advocates for state medical boards to revoke the licenses of doctors who spread disinformation and prescribe unproven treatments. This “anti-science, anti-government movement” is taking advantage of a fringe group of doctors’ medical credentials to amplify and legitimize a harmful agenda, Sawyer says.\n\nBut what shocked Sawyer the most was “the blatantly partisan and violent nature of the speakers’ rhetoric.” The shadow of the Jan. 6, 2021 rallies—which culminated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol—seemed to linger over the event. “Unfortunately, many people who wanted to come were scared to join because of it being so close to Jan. 6,” says Kaitlin Derstine, who organized a bus to the rally from Pennsylvania, filled with nearly 50 people from a conservative parents’ group.\n\nA Defeat the Mandates banner is displayed in front of the Lincoln Memorial on Jan. 23. Stefani Reynolds—AFP/Getty Images\n\nA man wears an Un-Vaccinated arm band at a Defeat the Mandates march. Kent Nishimura—Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nOn a marathon seven-hour livestream of the rally, hundreds of participants were ecstatic. “They now know we are no longer a fringe group,” one participant said jubilantly. “What can we do next?” another woman asked. “I know there’s more.”\n\nOrganizers sought to funnel that energy towards political participation. They directed supporters to contact their members of Congress and their local government officials, and urged them to support a Jan. 24 panel hosted by Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, which featured some of the same speakers.\n\nWhile no members of Congress were featured at the rally, some of them expressed their support on social media. “God bless all the brave people protesting against vaccine mandates!” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican who has racked up more than $90,000 in fines for refusing to wear a mask on the House floor, wrote on Telegram. “I’m not vaccinated either and support medical freedom for all Americans.”\n\nIt’s clear the issue is a growing litmus test on the political right. Last summer, nearly half of House Republicans refused to say whether they had been vaccinated when asked by CNN. In Georgia, neither of the Republican frontrunners for the U.S. Senate nomination will say whether they received the vaccine. Earlier this month, a GOP city council member in New York City refused to disclose her vaccination status, even though doing so barred her from entering the chamber.\n\nA bus with photos of prominent scientific and tech community members is seen ahead of a Defeat the Mandates march in Washington. Kent Nishimura—Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nWhile Trump recently criticized DeSantis for declining to say whether he had received the booster, many of the rally goers were with DeSantis on the issue. Some carried DeSantis and “Make America Florida” banners. “You think Trump would get it after he’s gotten booed like ten times now,” said Holly, who did not want to give her last name but said she was 32-year-old nurse who had lost her job at a Houston hospital for refusing to get the vaccine. “Why does he want them to win?”\n\nIt’s this “us versus them” language that is uniting many of these groups and could make the movement a powerful political force, says Renee DiResta, who leads research on anti-vaccine disinformation at the Stanford Internet Observatory. DiResta predicts the movement will attempt to sink candidates who don’t malign vaccine mandates in upcoming GOP primaries. “That is the strategy I think we’ll see in 2022,” she says.\n\nBy uniting under an anti-mandate umbrella, groups and candidates supporting anti-vaccine and more extremist views will likely be able to evade moderation by social media platforms and organize online, DiRests says. “The ‘vaccines are tyrannical government overreach’ argument is still a permissible one that can be made, because [social media companies] don’t want to look like they’re putting their thumb on the scale of a political issue.”\n\nRead More: How An Online Pharmacy Sold Millions Worth of Dubious COVID-19 Drugs—While Patients Paid the Price.\n\nHaywood, the Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from North Carolina, says standing up against vaccine mandates will be a key part of his political platform. He also says he plans to keep up with what Kennedy Jr. and some of the other speakers at the rally continue to say. “It’s about taking a stand against the government,” he says. “They need to be routed out and brought to justice.”",

    "text": "Two-thirds of anti-vaccination propaganda posted online is created by just 12 so-called influencers, research has found.\n\nDifferent to those who describe themselves vaccine hesitant, anti-vaxxers tend to employ aggressive methods to persuade others not to get injections designed to help prevent disease.\n\nThe list was compiled by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and found most of the figures, who claim to be political or medical leaders, are based in America.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:49 Boris Johnson has previously spoken out against anti-vaxxers\n\nAfter social media companies were made aware of the prevalence of the material some was removed, but many videos and articles remain online today.\n\nCritics believe some are exploiting loopholes which mean that if they post content under another name or appear on a page hosted by another user their anti-vax content is not removed.\n\nImran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, told Sky News that social media giants \"bear none of the cost for the content\" they host, including dangerous material which can drive users to their platforms.\n\nHe called on the companies to do more to remove it quickly, amid fears that those left unvaccinated remained more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and, crucially, hospitalisation.\n\nHe said the most effective anti-vaxxers were \"great marketers\" and drew people in by generating content related to wellness or fertility, then gradually linked these issues to vaccination.\n\nMr Ahmed said the algorithms used by social media platforms then fed people more and more similar content, until they see it frequently while online - thus normalising the opinions.\n\n\"All the platforms care about is content that people will spend time on so they can serve them adverts at the same time… they are reluctant to take any credible action,\" he said.\n\nImage: CCDH chief exec Imran Ahmed says social media platforms 'are reluctant to take any credible action'\n\nEd Stubbs, a teacher who developed a package of lessons designed to tackle vaccine hesitancy in schools, said that because young people spent so much time online they could easily find themselves watching a lot of anti-vax content.\n\nHe warned that fear over the COVID-19 vaccine programme had fed into fears about other vaccines administered to young people as a matter of course in schools and prompted growing general hesitancy to getting vaccinated for anything.\n\n\"Young people obviously look on social media, they see quite a lot of jokes on Instagram and Tik Tok, things like 'I got my vaccine and then this happened to me',\" he said.\n\n\"They are jokes and the students would even tell me and be laughing while they say them, but it still has an effect on them and instead of vaccines being something quite dull, boring, and necessary, it's something that is controversial, weird and slightly alarming.\"\n\nMr Stubbs added that labelling people who are vaccine hesitant as anti-vaxxers can be dangerous, especially in schools, as it drives discussion underground and gives teachers less opportunity to open up conversations which could encourage uptake.\n\nBut he also warned that teachers must be prepared to be unequivocal about the benefits of getting vaccine and not sit on the fence, because they are in a position of trust.\n\nImage: Minister Chris Philp admits that policing the internet is not an easy task\n\nChris Philp, a minister in the department for digital, culture, media and sport, said the government would legislate for fines and other action to force social media companies to remove content deemed damaging but admitted that policing the internet was not an easy task.\n\n\"The internet is a large space and there is definitely more to do and we are determined to make sure that with social media firms, we take the action necessary,\" he said.\n\n\"There's always more to do. And in fact, in the coming months, we're going to be introducing a piece of legislation, the online safety bill, to go even further in imposing statutory legal duties on social media firms to make sure they act in this area.\"",

    "title": "Anti-Vaxxers Are Grifting Off the Measles Outbreak—and Claim a Bioweapon Caused It",
    "text": "Anti-vaccine activists with close ties to US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are falsely claiming that the measles public health crisis in Texas is caused by a “bioweapon” targeting the Mennonite community. These activists are now trying to sell their followers a range of pseudoscientific cures—some purportedly powered by artificial intelligence—that supposedly prevent customers from contracting measles.\n\nThe claims were made in a webinar posted online last week and hosted by Mikki Willis, an infamous conspiracy filmmaker best known for his Plandemic series of pseudo-documentaries. These helped supercharge Covid-19 disinformation online and were, Kennedy has said, funded in part by Children’s Health Defense (CHD), an anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded. Willis also created a video for Kennedy marking the announcement of his independent run for the presidency.\n\n“I’m not going to be careful by calling it a virus,” Willis said in the measles webinar. “I’m going to call it what it is, and that is a bioweapon, and my belief after interviewing these families is that this has been manipulated and targeted towards a community that is a threat because of their natural way of living.” (Measles is not a bioweapon. It is a viral infection that can be easily prevented by getting a vaccine.)\n\nThe webinar was hosted by Rebel Lion, the supplement company that Willis cofounded. On the website, and prominently featured under the webinar, Willis sells and recommends a “measles treatment and prevention protocol” full of supplements and tools on the site. On the webinar, Willis claimed the protocol will help parents “get prepped for, if God forbid this does get out, and their children get sick.” Together, purchasing the full protocol costs hundreds of dollars.\n\n“This is the standard radical anti-vaccine extremist playbook,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, tells WIRED. “You can see RFK Jr. has translated his anti-vaccine lies into political power. You can see others have converted it into economic power. And there’s some that just do it because it makes them feel good to be listened to, to be important, to be the center of a community. There’s always an ulterior motive.”\n\nThe community Willis refers to in the webinar is the Mennonite community in Seminole, a small city in west Texas, which has been the epicenter of the measles outbreak. Over 560 measles cases have been reported in Texas alone. To date, the deaths of two children have been linked to the measles outbreak, and another death is under investigation.\n\nWillis’ bogus claim about a bioweapon is part of a larger effort by the anti-vaccine community to undermine the threat posed by the infection. Many, instead, have claimed that the measles deaths were caused by other diseases or, in some cases, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine itself. These claims are not true and “there have been no deaths shown to be related to the MMR vaccine in healthy people,” according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America.",

    "title": "The Anti-Vax Movement Isn’t Going Away. We Must Adapt to It",
    "text": "Navin, PhD, HEC-C, is Professor and Chair of Philosophy at Oakland University (Rochester, MI) and Clinical Ethicist at Corewell Health. His research is primarily in clinical ethics and ethics in public health. Attwell, PhD, is an Associate Professor in Public Policy at the University of Western Australia, where she leads VaxPolLab, and she is an Honorary Fellow of Wesfarmers Centre of Vaccines and Infectious Diseases at Telethon Kids Institute. Her research focuses on vaccination social science and policy. They are authors of the book America's New Vaccine Wars: California and the Politics of Mandates\n\nAmerica’s immunization policies are facing a bleak future. Political polarization about vaccine policies is likely to cause outbreaks of previously controlled infectious diseases. If we cannot prevent these disasters, we should pivot our focus towards managing them.\n\nResistance to vaccination is not a new problem, but the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated it. It should be clear by now that neither persuasion nor coercion is sufficient to change the minds or the behavior of people who are determined to refuse vaccines. Education and research cannot defeat coordinated misinformation. And government efforts—at federal, state, and local levels—are stymied by a combination of inadequate power, insufficient political will, and a lack of perceived legitimacy by vaccine refusers. One of America’s core lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a heavy-handed response to vaccine refusal can make things worse.\n\nMany U.S. states have ended their COVID-19 vaccine mandates. But America’s childhood vaccine mandates for school entry are also vulnerable. As researchers of vaccination social science, ethics, and policy, we have sometimes encountered an optimistic view that immunization in America will soon snap back to a pre-pandemic “normal.” But this hope ignores the cracks that were already present in America’s immunization social order before the pandemic, cracks that COVID-19 only widened. State-based conflicts over school enrollment vaccine mandates became increasingly political and contentious during the 2010s. Continued political polarization about vaccine mandates is likely to reduce immunization rates and precipitate the return of previously controlled diseases. That’s why it’s time to adapt to vaccine refusal and prepare to manage these outbreaks, rather than hope they can be prevented.\n\nMore From TIME\n\nAll American states require vaccines for school enrollment, but most permit parents to opt out of vaccinating by obtaining a nonmedical exemption. Nonmedical exemptions may be available based upon religious or personal beliefs, depending on the state. Attempts to change these exemption policies have emerged as polarizing flashpoints for Democrats and Republicans. In 2015, California took the unprecedented first step of eliminating nonmedical exemptions to its vaccine requirements to reduce rates of vaccine refusal. Since 2015, Democrats, major physician organizations like the American Medical Association, and pro-vaccine parent activists have tried to remove nonmedical exemptions in many other states.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have now eliminated nonmedical exemptions in California, New York, Washington State (for measles vaccine), Maine, and Connecticut. New national organizations, like the Safe Families Coalition, are pushing for similar changes in many other states. Where Democrats organized to abolish vaccine opt-outs, Republicans fought to protect or expand them. The fight continues, as Republicans look for ways to further weaken childhood vaccine mandates. A case in point: on 17 April this year a Republican judge in Mississippi reinstated a religious exemption to that state’s vaccine mandates that courts had overturned in 1979.\n\nAttempts to scrap nonmedical exemptions inject new kinds of coercion into a fracturing immunization social order. This intensifies the politicization of school vaccine mandates and erodes public support for these critical policies. Conflicts about COVID-19 pandemic control measures were not outliers, but instead signs of a crumbling immunization consensus. The bitter truth is that nonpartisan vaccine policy was dead before the world had heard of COVID-19.\n\nRemoving nonmedical vaccine exemptions will not overcome vaccine refusal or prevent outbreaks. Only in states where Democrats control all levers of state power can such bills pass, given unified Republican opposition. These policies can deliver local increases in immunization rates. However, even in Democrat-led states, enforcement is likely to be uneven at best, and to be worse in communities where immunization rates are already low. For example, the leadership of private schools is unlikely to enforce strict vaccine mandates that they believe are inconsistent with their values, or that will cause them to lose substantial tuition revenue.\n\nLocal successes in Democrat-led states are likely to be overshadowed by immunization policy failures in Republican-led states. In the current political climate, Democrats own the issue of eliminating nonmedical exemptions. In contrast, Republicans have emerged as champions of preserving and expanding them, or even of eliminating mandates altogether. Republicans will weaken existing mandates in the states that they control, and this will lead to lower immunization rates in those places, and perhaps beyond, as vaccination policy embeds more deeply in America’s culture wars.\n\nRead More: How the Anti-Vax Movement Is Taking Over the Right\n\nThe implications are significant. The near future likely portends escalating disputes about immunization policy, lower vaccination rates, and a resurgence of diseases once tamed by vaccines. Our response should be to adapt to widespread vaccine refusal rather than to nurture naïve hopes of overcoming it. If we can’t prevent outbreaks, we will need to learn to live with them.\n\nPublic health institutions have a crucial role in this shift towards adaptation. They must enhance their capacities, extending COVID-19 surveillance techniques like sewage sampling to encompass other diseases. This method helped New York State Department of Health detect polio virus in wastewater samples in 2022. There is also an urgent need to train medical professionals in diagnosing and treating vaccine-preventable diseases that were once thought to be controlled or eliminated. And governments should prepare to rapidly deploy mobile clinics and response teams to areas hit by outbreaks.\n\nCommunity-level planning is essential for adapting to more frequent outbreaks in schools and other institutions. Strategies should include the ability to move between in-person and online schooling and the provision of daycare services for essential workers’ children, especially to safeguard the capacities of health care institutions.\n\nPrivate institutions, from businesses to cultural organizations, must plan their own disease control measures. These may include private vaccine mandates, although state legislatures may outlaw such policies, as some did for COVID-19. However, businesses will be able to keep the assembly lines going and the service counters staffed only if they can reduce the impact of disease on their workforce.\n\nGiven the prospect of uneven state and institutional support for vaccination, individuals and families must also brace themselves for more frequent disease outbreaks. Some new parents already prevent unvaccinated relatives from visiting their babies. Families will need to consider extending these forms of private immunization governance when states can no longer protect them.\n\nWe are not talking about “giving up.” Governments should continue to promote vaccine acceptance and enforce vaccine mandates. The right kinds of outreach can sway some people who are on the fence about vaccinating. But these efforts alone are unlikely to be sufficient to prevent future outbreaks. Adapting to the times we live in is the only way forward.",

    "title": "The Influence of the Anti-Vaccine Movement",
    "text": "This week, Americans began receiving COVID-19 vaccines, with the hope that by the middle of next year a pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than three hunded thousand Americans will be brought under control. Misinformation about the virus has been a staple of both the Trump Administration’s messaging and much of the junk science found on the Internet. Now, that misinformation will intersect with an American public that is already somewhat skeptical about vaccines, potentially imperilling the effort to get a sufficient number of Americans vaccinated. (The Times reported on Wednesday that many of the people spreading false claims about voter fraud have switched their messaging to the dangers of vaccines.)\n\nTo try to understand why anti-vaccine sentiment is so prevalent in the United States, I recently spoke by phone with Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology at Baylor College of Medicine, and the co-director of the Texas Children’s Center for Vaccine Development. In March, he will publish a book called “Preventing the Next Pandemic: Vaccine Diplomacy in a Time of Anti-Science.” During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the historical reasons for vaccine skepticism among many Black Americans, how doctors can speak the truth without appearing political, and how the fight over vaccines became so similar to the fight over every political issue in America.\n\nWhen we’re talking about why people are resistant to vaccines, how much is that a question for doctors to answer, and how much is it a question for social scientists or other people to answer?\n\nNot all vaccines are created equal, and each vaccine has its own set of issues around hesitancy. In general, when we’re talking about vaccines, we’re usually talking about vaccines for kids. And the three vaccines that are primarily targeted are the M.M.R. vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella; the H.P.V. vaccine; and the flu vaccine. What’s happened in the United States is that, historically, there has been a rise and fall of anti-vaccine sentiment ever since colonial times, with smallpox vaccinations. But the modern piece of this really started to accelerate in the early two-thousands, after a paper by Andrew Wakefield and his colleague was published in The Lancet, falsely claiming that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine had the ability to cause autism. Back then they called it pervasive developmental disorder.\n\nThat whole thing was debunked by a journalist for the Times of London, a guy named Brian Deer, who wrote a series of articles, first in the Times and then in the British Medical Journal, the BMJ. And that Lancet paper ultimately got retracted, but not until 2010. So that period enabled an anti-vaccine movement to flourish in the U.K., and then it took off in the United States. And in the United States it acquired its own flavor, in that, starting around 2014 or 2015, it got linked to the political right under this fake banner that they called “health freedom, medical freedom.” It started in Southern California, but it really got amplified here in Texas, and we started to see a steep increase in parents who were opting their kids out of getting vaccinated. And it coincided with the formation of these political-action committees, Texans for Vaccine Choice, Oklahomans for Vaccine and Health Choice. And they started getting money from organizations that traditionally would support the Tea Party and other far-right-wing causes. So they gave money, and power, and strength, and political alliances. And then it really took off with Robert F. Kennedy and his anti-vaccine group, Children’s Health Defense, which became one of the first major national anti-vaccine groups.\n\nOne of the things that seems interesting about anti-vaccine sentiment is that it is a far-right thing in certain ways, but it also crosses certain ideological lines. If you look at some of the places where opposition to vaccinations for children is highest, it’s places like Santa Monica and Marin County, which I don’t think of as part of a right wing—\n\nYeah, or in Seattle. So there’s a Pacific Northwest flavor to that, which is linked more to the health-and-wellness industry. The point is the anti-vaccine lobby doesn’t all speak with one voice. That’s absolutely true. That’s why I sometimes call it a confederacy more than one single organization. And that gets to the sources of funding as well, which we don’t really understand. Some of it’s coming from the health-and-wellness industry selling fake supplements and autism cures, while a lot of it is getting money from far-right-wing political causes. But it’s gotten very powerful now, to the point it really dominates the Internet.\n\nYou alluded to anti-vaccination sentiment rising and falling since colonial times. Is there a through line that can help us understand why sentiment rises or falls, or why distinct populations see sentiment within them rise or fall? Or is it just things like this Lancet paper, about which it would be hard to come up with some sort of historical explanation?\n\nIt comes from different causes. So for instance, because I have a daughter with autism, I wrote this book “Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism.” In the book, I report on doing a PubMed search, where you type in key words like autism and vaccines, and you do see one paper comes out of 1976, and a guy who was looking at smallpox vaccination and wondering, “Could there be a link to autism?” And then nothing. And then all of a sudden the Wakefield paper comes, and this thing just blows up after that.\n\nSo clearly it’s that Wakefield paper that was the trigger. But what gave it momentum, though, I think, was the political alliances and links. And again, under this banner of health freedom, we’re seeing that stuff expand this year. Because while it was very focussed on vaccines —which, by the way, started bringing people like Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones into it—in 2020 it glommed on to the protest against masks and social distancing. So what was an anti-vaccine movement then morphed into a full-on anti-science movement.\n\nAnd then the other thing that happened this year, which I hadn’t seen before, was it went outside the U.S. and North America. It went to western Europe. So you started seeing these protests in Paris and Berlin and London, again using that same health-freedom language. And we have anti-mask and anti-vaccine rallies. There are other versions of anti-vaccine activities globally, but this one had that American spin to it that I hadn’t seen before.\n\nAccording to polls, if you ask people about their skepticism of COVID-19 vaccines, you see that Black and Latino adults are more skeptical. At the same time, you see Republicans as much more skeptical than Democrats. The explanation for the former has traditionally been that the medical community has a very checkered history with nonwhite populations in this country and elsewhere. Is that how you see it?\n\nIt’s the thing you mentioned. I think the other is the absence of African-American health-care providers, especially physicians, especially male physicians. We really are doing a very bad job training African-American physicians. But the third piece that no one really talks about, which I think is quite important, if you start looking into it, is that these anti-vaccine groups staged anti-vaccine rallies in Harlem in 2019. So I think there was specific targeting of African-American groups. The movement targets specific groups. It went after the Somali-immigrant community in Minnesota in 2017, and it basically generated a measles epidemic. Then they went after the Orthodox Jewish community in New York in 2018, 2019. And they use very inflammatory, exploitative language, comparing vaccines to the Holocaust.",

    "title": "Children's Health Defense",
    "text": "American anti-vaccination activist group\n\nFor the children's rights and educational non-profit, see Children's Defense Fund\n\nChildren's Health Defense (CHD) is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit activist group mainly known for anti-vaccine advocacy and is one of the main sources of misinformation on vaccines.[1][2][3][4][5] Founded as World Mercury Project in 2007 by Eric Gladen, it was chaired by lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from 2015 to 2023.[6]\n\nThe group has campaigned against various public health programs, such as vaccination and fluoridation of drinking water.[7] The group has contributed to vaccine hesitancy in the United States, encouraging citizens and legislators to support anti-vaccine regulations and legislation,[8][9] although arguments against vaccination are contradicted by general scientific consensus.[10][11][12][13]\n\nThe group's US$15-million budget is funded through donations from individuals (both directly and anonymized through foundations) and affiliate marketing revenues.\n\nBackground\n\nThe group was founded in 2007 under the name of World Mercury Project by activist Eric Gladen. Under Gladen, who produced the anti-vaccination film Trace Amounts in 2014, World Mercury Project remained a relatively minor group. It had annual revenue of $13,000 in 2014, which jumped to $470,000 in revenue in 2015, when Kennedy joined the board. In 2018 it changed its name to Children's Health Defense.[1][14][15]\n\nThe group alleges that a large proportion of American children have conditions as diverse as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, food allergies, cancer, and autoimmune diseases due to exposure to a variety of chemicals and radiation.[16] The chemicals and radiation that the group has blamed and campaigned against include vaccines, pesticides, fluoridation of drinking water, paracetamol (acetaminophen), aluminum, wireless communications.[17][18] It has brought lawsuits targeting pesticides in food and agriculture.[19]\n\nAlleging widespread corruption within health care research and collusion by multiple governments, the group endorsed a 2017 edition of the book Judy Mikovits wrote about her discredited theories, with Kennedy writing the foreword.[7] Kennedy's book The Real Anthony Fauci, published in 2021, repeats several discredited myths about the COVID-19 pandemic, notably about the effectiveness of ivermectin.[6] During the pandemic, the group accused the United States government of supporting research on a vaccine as part of a plan to increase revenues for the pharmaceutical industry.[16]\n\nThe growth of the group during the pandemic gave rise to international chapters, notably in Canada, Europe and Australia.[6]\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr's involvement\n\nChildren's Health Defense is an influential anti-vaccine organization due to the prominence of its chairman, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.[8][9][7] In April 2023, Kennedy took leave when he started his campaign as candidate for the position of President of the United States. As a non-profit group, Children's Health Defense may not endorse political candidates, but in November 2023, the group gave its first Defender Award to Kennedy for \"his courage and steadfast commitment to truth and liberty\".[20]\n\nDespite Kennedy's claims that he is not against vaccines,[7][21][22] several critics point out he and his organization spread common anti-vaccine arguments as part of their core messages. According to David Gorski, the World Mercury project was \"a group dedicated to fear mongering over mercury in vaccines as a cause of autism and health problems\". Kennedy has stated the media and governments are engaged in a conspiracy to deny that vaccines cause autism.[9][23] Other misinformation promoted by Children's Health Defense is a conspiracy theory in relation to the Great Reset that claims that elites, including Bill Gates, plan to take over the United States and establish a Marxist high-control regime.[24]\n\nKennedy met with Donald Trump in January 2017. While Kennedy claimed the President agreed to establish a commission to study the risks allegedly associated with vaccines, government officials denied any decision was taken and nothing subsequently came of it.[25][26]\n\nOn February 15, 2017, with other anti-vaccination activists and actor Robert De Niro at his side, Kennedy challenged anybody to prove the use of thimerosal is safe \"in the amounts contained in vaccines currently being administered to American children and pregnant women\", ignoring a 1999 Food and Drug Administration review doing just that. Although the use of thimerosal in vaccines was phased out by 2001 (with one exception), this mercury compound is still often mentioned by anti-vaccination groups.[9][27][28] Overwhelming evidence indicates that vaccines are safe and effective.[9][23]\n\nOn May 8, 2019, while some areas in the United States were struggling with a resurgence of measles due to low vaccination rates, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Joseph P. Kennedy, and Maeve Kennedy McKean publicly stated that while their relative Robert had championed many admirable causes, he \"has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines.\"[29]\n\nKennedy's compensation has risen with the nonprofit's revenue. According to federal tax returns filed by the group, his salary was $131,000 in 2017, rising to $345,000 in 2020, and eventually totaling $500,000 for 2021 and 2022.[30][31] In 2023, Kennedy was paid $326,000 for 15 weeks of work before taking leave to run for president.[32] However, after being nominated for the position of Health and Human Services secretary following the 2024 United States elections, documentation filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics indicating those amounts corresponded to his after-tax income rather than gross income. His actual income from Children's Health Defense was thus $836,571 in 2022, while the 2023 figure of $326,056 appears to be correct. Income from previous years was not corrected.[33]\n\nAfter Kennedy's departure, Mary Holland was appointed as Chief Executive Officer.[34] Kennedy later became the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services on February 13, 2025.\n\nAnti-vaccination campaigns\n\nChildren's Health Defense petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in May 2021 to have authorization of all COVID-19 vaccines resciended, and to refuse to authorize any other vaccine protecting against the disease in the future.[35][36] The petition was filed by Kennedy and advisory board member Meryl Nass, a doctor who saw her license suspended by the Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine in 2022.[37][38][39] Kennedy and Nass advocated for the use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine instead of vaccination, even though those two drugs were already known at the time to be ineffective against COVID.[35]\n\nThe organization uses social media and internet advertising to propagate anti-vaccination messages, targeting young parents and minorities in the United States.[1][2] During the COVID-19 pandemic, those communications attempted to downplay the risk posed by the virus, to argue the new vaccines are dangerous, and to undermine public health authorities. The Center for Countering Digital Hate identifies the group as one of the leaders of the anti-vaccination movement online.[3] In August 2022, the organization's accounts on Meta platforms, Facebook and Instagram, were terminated for repeatedly breaching the platforms' policies.[40] While Instagram removed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s account from its platform in February 2021, it did not take any measure against the Children's Health Defense account. Between Instagram and Facebook, the organization had a reach of 300,000 subscribers in 2021.[41][42][43]\n\nThe organization also organized rallies against public health measures aiming at mitigating the impact of the pandemic, such as the one in Washington on January 23, 2022. This particular demonstration featured other leaders of the American anti-vaccination movement such as Del Bigtree; both Kennedy and Bigtree compared vaccine mandates to oppression in Nazi-occupied countries during World War II. The demonstration was also attended by a group from neo-fascist organization Proud Boys.[44][45][46]\n\nCHD targets Black Americans with messaging linking COVID-19 vaccination with the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and other instances when ethical violations have been committed against minorities as part of medical studies. Such interventions are likely to hurt the Black community by increasing vaccine hesitancy within that vulnerable population.[47] Echoing other actors in the anti-vaccination movement and Nation of Islam, Children's Health Defense claims that the United States government seeks to harm ethnic minorities by prioritizing them for COVID vaccines. The conspiracy theory is elaborated upon in an hour-long video production Medical Racism: The New Apartheid released in March 2021 by Children's Health Defense and Kennedy. The video also contains recycled anti-vaccination stories about autism, Bill Gates and the Centers for Disease Control. Like other such conspiracy theory videos, it inserts true historical events into its narrative to make its fantastic claims appear more believable.[1][48]\n\nThe organization's social media channels have been shown to amplify conspiracy theories common to other anti-vaccination groups as well as QAnon, such as the \"Great Reset\" and the \"Deep state\".[3][49][50] A regular output of videos under the heading of \"CHD TV\" presents their audience with commentary and interviews related to various conspiracy theories.[51]\n\nA study found Children's Health Defense was one of major buyers of anti-vaccine Facebook advertising in December 2018 and February 2019, the other being Stop Mandatory Vaccination. Heavily targeting women and young couples, the advertising highlighted the alleged risks of vaccines and asked for donations.[2][52] According to an analysis by NBC News, the group is one of three major sources of false claims on vaccination shared on the internet, the other two being the fake news site Natural News and the website Stop Mandatory Vaccination.[4] Facebook subsequently refused to carry anti-vaccination advertising from the group.[53][1]\n\nChildren's Health Defense said that the efficacy of its non-advertising Facebook campaigns has been greatly affected by the platform taking additional measures against misinformation in 2019. In a lawsuit filed with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in August 2020, against Facebook and four fact-checking services, the group said the viewership of some of its posts on vaccination and 5G wireless was reduced by 95% after they were labelled as misinformation. Even though those messages were allowed to be posted by the group and shared by users, Children Health Defense argues that labelling them as misinformation amounts to censorship; they allege their messages are presented merely as opinions rather than information and as such, cannot be characterized as misinformation.[7][53][54][55] The organization is seeking $5 million in damages.[1]\n\nCHD's film division produced the 2024 video production Vaxxed III: Authorized To Kill. Promoted as a sequel of the 2016 Vaxxed, it presents testimonies of people who were allegedly injured following being vaccinated during the COVID-19 pandemic.[56][57]\n\nIn January 2023, CHD filed a complaint alleging the efforts of major news outlets to limit the spread of COVID-19 misinformation amount to a violation to the Sherman Antitrust Act. The complaint targets The Washington Post, the BBC, Associated Press and Reuters. Along with CHD and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the plaintiffs include other major spreaders of misinformation, including Joseph Mercola, Ty and Charlene Bollinger, Erin Elizabeth, Ben Tapper, Ben Swann and Jim Hoft. They present themselves as \"online news publishers\" victimized by media policies aiming at providing accurate reporting of COVID-related information.[58][59] The case will be heard by United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas judge Matthew Kacsmaryk.[60]\n\nDuring the 2025 Southwest United States measles outbreak CHD published a video interview of the Mennonite parents of a six-year-old Texas girl who, in February 2025, became the first child to die of measles in the United States in around 20 years. The father said that \"measles are good for the body\". The mother told other parents regarding the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine: \"Don't do the shots\" with measles being \"not as bad as they're making it out to be.\"[61] The Centers for Disease Control says \"Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, or rubella\".[62]\n\nCHD hosted a deceptive web site on vaccines and autism visually identical to a public-information CDC web page on the same topic. While the CDC page was clear on the absence of autism risks, the CHD pages described debunked anti-vaccine autism research mixed in with medically accepted research. The CHD web page, which featured the CDC banner and logo and the headline \"Vaccine Safety\", included testimonials from anti-vaccine parents, e.g. one titled \"Mother of 3: I Will Never Vaccinate Again\". The deceptive page was removed in March, 2025 at the request of the U.S. government.[63]\n\nFunding\n\nFrom $13,000 in annual revenue in 2014, World Mercury Project brought in $470,000 in revenue in 2015, when Kennedy joined the organization. Its revenues increased to $1.1 million in 2018. With the group becoming a major disinformation hub during the COVID-19 pandemic, its revenue reached $6.8 million in 2020, $15 million in 2021, counting among its new donors LimeWire's founder Mark Gorton,[6][64] and $23.5 million in 2022.[31] With Kennedy on leave from his position for most of 2023, the group's revenue fell to $16 million.[65]\n\nChildren's Health Defense has received substantial anonymized funding via donor-advised funds. According to Rolling Stone, the Fidelity Charitable fund channelled $1 million to Children's Health Defense and some of its state chapters in 2021–2022; the Vanguard Charitable fund gave $1.5 million to the national group and its California chapter between 2020 and 2022; and the Morgan Stanley Global Impact Funding Trust fund channelled $680,000 to the national group and its New York chapter in 2020 and 2021. Another donor-advised fund, the National Christian Foundation, gave a total of $630,000 to the group in 2020 and 2021. Smaller anonymized donations received during the COVID-19 pandemic included Fairfield County’s Community Foundation ($200,000) and the Chicago Community Trust ($100,000).[66]\n\nThe organization receives a portion of the sales of Ty Bollinger's anti-vaccination video series, which it promotes.[67] Despite its messaging impeding the government's efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19, Children's Health Defense received $145,400 in federally backed small business loans through the Paycheck Protection Program from JPMorgan Chase in 2020.[24][68][69] The 2021 tax return for Children's Health Defense indicates that Kennedy was paid above $500,000 for his services as chairman and chief counsel for the organization.[70]\n\nChildren's Health Defense initiated a number of court cases, with little success. Requests for contributions to its litigation funds are a major component of its fundraising activities.[58]\n\nGiven the impact they had during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, ethicist Arthur Caplan commented that funding Children's Health Defense and similar groups might have grave consequence in future epidemics.[31]\n\nLawsuits\n\nChildren's Health Defense has initiated a number of court cases against governments, agencies, and media companies, all of which are pending or have been dismissed.\n\nOn April 19, 2019, the Kings County (New York) Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit in which Robert Krakow, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Patricia Finn of Children's Health Defense represented five parents of unvaccinated children protesting the decision by New York City authorities to impose mandatory measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations for residents in parts of Williamsburg, New York, as a response to the epidemic of measles in that area. The lawsuit was filed four days earlier against the New York City Department of Health and Human Hygiene and its commissioner.[71][72] In his ruling, Judge Lawrence Knipel said that the arguments presented by the plaintiffs amounted to little more than \"unsupported, bald faced opinion\". Responding to Children's Health Defense's claims that the city's reaction to a \"garden-variety annual measles outbreak\" was excessive, the judge pointed out that the documents filed as evidence in fact demonstrated otherwise. He concluded that \"the unvarnished truth is that these diagnoses represent the most significant spike in incidences of measles in the United States in many years and that the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn is at its epicenter. It has already begun to spread to remote locations.\"[72][73]\n\nOn August 17, 2020, Children's Health Defense sued Poynter Institute for Media Studies, Facebook, and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, claiming that Politifact censored a truthful public health statement about vaccines through its fact checking. The case was dismissed for failure to state an actionable claim on June 30, 2021.[74] Children's Health Defense has appealed.\n\nOn August 16, 2021, Children's Health Defense sued Rutgers because of their vaccine mandate. A federal court dismissed the suit on September 23, 2022.[75]\n\nOn August 31, 2021, Children's Health Defense sued the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approving the COVID-19 vaccine for children. The federal court dismissed the complaint with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction on January 12, 2023.[76] CHD has appealed.\n\nOn January 10, 2023, Children's Health Defense sued Reuters, AP, BBC, and the Washington Post in an antitrust suit, claiming that these groups were working together to keep certain opinions out of the media.

    "title": "Anti-vaccine activism",
    "text": "Activism against vaccination\n\nAn anti-vaccination activist holds a sign at a Tea Party Express rally in Minnesota in 2010.\n\nRally of the Anti-Vaccination League of Canada in 1919\n\nAnti-vaccine activism, which collectively constitutes the \"anti-vax\" movement,[1] is a set of organized activities expressing opposition to vaccination, and these collaborating networks have often sought to increase vaccine hesitancy by disseminating vaccine misinformation and/or forms of active disinformation. As a social movement, it has utilized multiple tools both within traditional news media and also through various forms of online communication. Activists have primarily (though far from entirely) focused on issues surrounding children, with vaccination of the young receiving pushback, and they have sought to expand beyond niche subgroups into national political debates.[2]\n\nIdeas that would eventually coalesce into anti-vaccine activism have existed for longer than vaccines themselves.[3] Various myths and conspiracy theories (alongside outright disinformation and misinformation) have been spread by the anti-vaccination movement and fringe doctors. These have been spread in a way that has significantly increased vaccine hesitancy (and altered public policy around ethical, legal, and medical matters related to vaccines). However, no serious sense of hesitancy or of debate (in the broad sense) exists within mainstream medical circles about the benefits of vaccination. The scientific consensus in favor of vaccines is \"clear and unambiguous\".[4] At the same time, however, the anti-vax movement has partially succeeded in distorting common understandings of science in popular culture.[2]\n\nStrategies and tactics [ edit ]\n\nArguments used [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2002 paper in the British Medical Journal, two medical historians suggested that the arguments made against the safety and effectiveness of vaccines in the late 20th century are similar to those of the early anti-vaccinationists. Both the 19th and 20th century arguments included \"vaccine safety issues, vaccine failures, infringement of personal liberty, and an unholy alliance between the medical establishment and the government to reap huge profits for the medical establishment at the expense of the public.\"[5] However, the authors only considered the use of \"newspaper articles and letters, books, journals, and pamphlets to warn against the dangers of vaccination\", and did not address the impact of the internet.[5] Comments on YouTube videos during the COVID-19 pandemic clustered similarly around \"concerns about side-effects, effectiveness, and lack of trust in corporations and government\".[6]\n\nMisrepresentation [ edit ]\n\nIn some instances, anti-vaccine organizations have used names intended to sound non-partisan on the issue: e.g. National Vaccine Information Center (USA), Vaccination Risk Awareness Network (Canada), Australian Vaccination Network.[7] In November 2013 the Australian Vaccination Network was ordered by the New South Wales Administrative Decisions Tribunal to change their name so that consumers are aware of the anti-vaccination nature of the group. Lateline reported that former AVN president Meryl Dorey \"claimed she was a victim of hate groups and vested interests\" in response to the ruling.[8]\n\nInformation quality [ edit ]\n\nAlthough physicians and nurses are still rated as the most trusted source for vaccine information, some vaccine-hesitant individuals report being more comfortable discussing vaccines with providers of complementary and alternative medical (CAM) treatments.[4] With the rise of the internet, many people have turned online for medical information.[9] In some instances, anti-vaccine activists seek to steer people away from vaccination and health-care providers and towards alternative medicines sold by certain activists.[10]\n\nAnti-vaccination writings on the internet have been argued to be characterized by a number of differences from medical and scientific literature. These include:\n\nFor example, a 2020 study examined Instagram posts related to the HPV vaccine, which can prevent some types of cancer. Anti-vaccine posts were more likely than pro-vaccine posts to be sent by non-healthcare individuals, to include personal narratives, and to reference other Instagram users, links, or reposts. Anti-vaccine posts were also more likely to involve concealment or distortion, particularly conspiracy theories and unsubstantiated claims. In total, 72.3% of antivaccine posts made inaccurate claims, including exaggerating the risks of vaccines and minimizing risks of disease.[17]\n\nDisinformation tactics [ edit ]\n\nA number of specific disinformation tactics have been noted in anti-vaccination messaging, including:[7][18]\n\nEconomics of vaccine disinformation [ edit ]\n\nInformation is more likely to be believed after repeated exposure. Disinformers use this illusory truth effect as a tactic, repeating false information to make it feel familiar and influence belief.[23] Anti-vaccine activists have leveraged social media to develop interconnected networks of influencers that shape people's opinion, recruit allies, impact policy[2] and monetize vaccine-related disinformation.[24] In 2022, the Journal of Communication published a study of the political economy underlying vaccine disinformation. Researchers identified 59 English-language \"actors\" that provided \"almost exclusively anti-vaccination publications\". Their websites monetized disinformation through appeals for donations, sales of content-based media and other merchandise, third-party advertising, and membership fees. Some maintained a group of linked websites, attracting visitors with one site and appealing for money and selling merchandise on others. Their activities to gain attention and obtain funding displayed a \"hybrid monetization strategy\". They attracted attention by combining eye-catching aspects of \"junk news\" and online celebrity promotion. At the same time, they developed campaign-specific communities to publicize and legitimize their position, similar to radical social movements.[24]\n\nMisrepresentation of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [ edit ]\n\nIn the United States, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to gather information on potential vaccine adverse reactions, but is susceptible to unverified reports, misattribution, underreporting, and inconsistent data quality.[25] Raw, unverified data from VAERS has often been used by the anti-vaccine community to justify misinformation regarding the safety of vaccines; it is generally not possible to find out from VAERS data if a vaccine caused an adverse event, or how common the event might be.[26]\n\nLegal action [ edit ]\n\nAfter Republicans gained a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in January 2023, the House Judiciary Committee used legal action to oppose both disinformation research and government involvement in fighting disinformation. One of the projects targeted was the Virality Project, which has examined the spread of false claims about vaccines. The House Judiciary Committee sent letters, subpoenas, and threats of legal action to researchers, demanding notes, emails and other records from researchers and even student interns, dating back to 2015. Institutions subjected to such inquiries included the Stanford Internet Observatory at Stanford University, the University of Washington, the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab and the social media analytics firm Graphika. Researchers emphasized that they have academic freedom to study disinformation as well as freedom of speech to report their results.[27][28][29]\n\nDespite conservative claims that the government acted to censor speech online, \"no evidence has emerged that government officials coerced the companies to take action against accounts\".[27] The actions of the House Judiciary Committee have been described as an \"attempt to chill research,”[27] creating a \"chilling effect\"[28] through increased time demands, legal costs and online harassment of researchers.[28][27]\n\nHarassment [ edit ]\n\nPersons undertaking efforts to counter vaccine misinformation, including public health experts who use social media, have been targeted for harassment by anti-vaccine activists such as blogger Paul Thacker.[2][14][30]\n\nFor example, Slovakian physician Vladimír Krčméry was a prominent member of the government advisory team during the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia, and was the first person in that country to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Due to his prominent role in the vaccination campaign, Krčméry and his family became a target of anti-vaccine activists, who physically threatened him and his family.[31]\n\nIn June 2023, Texas-based physician and researcher Peter Hotez tweeted his concerns about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sharing misinformation about vaccines on Joe Rogan's podcast. Rogan, Kennedy, and Twitter owner Elon Musk asked Hotez to participate in a debate on the podcast. Upon declining the invitation, Hotez was harassed by their fans, with anti-vaccine activist Alex Rosen confronting him at his home.[14][32][33]\n\nIn his book The Deadly Rise of Anti-science: A Scientist's Warning, Hotez describes how he and other scientists who publicly defend vaccines have been attacked on social media, harassed with threatening emails, intimidated, and confronted physically by opponents of vaccination. He attributes the increase in aggressiveness of the anti-vaccination movement to the influence of the extreme wing of the Republican Party.[34][35] Hotez estimates that roughly 200,000 preventable deaths from COVID-19, mainly among Republicans, occurred in the US because of refusal to be vaccinated.[36][37]\n\nAt the extreme end, opposition to vaccination has resulted in substantial violence against vaccinators. In Pakistan, \"more than 200 polio team workers have lost their lives\" (team members include not only vaccinators but police and security personnel) from \"targeted killing and terrorism\" while working on polio vaccination campaigns.[38]\n\nCountering anti-vaccine activism [ edit ]\n\nVarious efforts have been suggested and undertaken to address concerns about vaccines and counter anti-vaccine disinformation. Efforts include social media advertising campaigns, by public health organizations, in support of public health goals.[39][6]\n\nBest practices for combating vaccine mis- and disinformation include addressing issues openly, clearly identifying areas of scientific consensus and areas of uncertainty, and being sensitive to the cultural and religious values of communities.[40][41][42] In countering anti-vaccine disinformation, both factual and emotional aspects need to be addressed.[43]\n\nWhether people will update a mistaken belief is complicated and involves psychological factors and social goals as well as accuracy of information.[44][23][20] There is some evidence that both debunking and \"pre-bunking\" of disinformation can be effective, at least in the short term.[23][20][45][46] Elements that may help to correct inaccurate information include: warning people before they are exposed to misinformation; high perceived credibility of message sources, affirmations of identity and social norms; graphical presentation; and focusing attention on clear core messages.[47] Alternative explanations of a situation need to fit plausibly into the original scenario and ideally indicate why the incorrect explanation was previously thought to be correct.[44]\n\nThe cultivation of critical thinking, health and science awareness, and media literacy skills are all recommended to help people more critically assess the credibility of the information they see.[42] People who seek out multiple reputable news sources at local and national levels are more likely to detect disinformation than those who rely on few sources from a particular viewpoint.[48] Particularly on social media, beware of sensational headlines that appeal to emotion, fact-check information broadly (not just through your usual sources), and consider possible agendas or conflicts of interest of those relaying information.[49][50]\n\nOperation of social media [ edit ]\n\nOther suggestions for countering anti-vaccine activism focus on changing the operation of social media platforms. Interventions such as accuracy nudges and source labeling change the context in which information is presented.[51] For example, correct information can be directly presented to counter disinformation.[52][53] Other possibilities include flagging or removing misleading information on social media platforms.[54][55][56] Research suggests that a majority of individuals in the United States would support the removal of harmful misinformation posts and the suspension of accounts. This position is less popular with Republicans than Democrats.[57]\n\nWhile private entities like Facebook, Twitter and Telegram could legally establish guidelines for moderation of information and disinformation on their platforms (subject to local and international laws)[58][50][59] such companies do not have strong incentives to control disinformation or to self-regulate. Algorithms that are used to maximize user engagement and profits can lead to unbalanced, poorly sourced, and actively misleading information.[60][61][62]\n\nCriticized for its role in vaccine hesitancy, Facebook announced in March 2019 that it would provide users with \"authoritative information\" on the topic of vaccines.[63] Facebook introduced several policies chosen to reduce the impact of anti-vaccine content, without actually removing it. These included reducing the ranking of anti-vaccine sources in searches and not recommending them; rejecting ads and targeted advertising that contained vaccine misinformation; and using banners to present vaccine information from authoritative sources. A study examined the six months before and after the policy changes. It found a moderate but significant decrease in the number of likes for anti-vaccine posts following the policy changes. Likes of pro-vaccine posts were unchanged.[64] Facebook has been criticized for not being more aggressive in countering disinformation.[65] In response to efforts to police misinformation, anti-vaccine communities on social media have adopted coded language to refer to vaccinated persons and the vaccines themselves.[66]\n\nSupply-side interventions reduce circulation of misinformation directly at their sources through actions such as application of social media policies, regulation, and legislation.[51] A study published in the journal Vaccine examined advertisements posted in the three months prior to the Facebook's 2019 policy changes. It found that 54% of the anti-vaccine advertisements on Facebook were placed by just two organizations, funded by well-known anti-vaccination activists.[67][68] The Children's Health Defense / World Mercury Project chaired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Stop Mandatory Vaccination, run by campaigner Larry Cook, posted 54% of the advertisements. The ads often linked to commercial products, such as natural remedies and books.[69] Kennedy was suspended from Facebook in August 2022,[70] but reinstated in June 2023.[71]\n\nIn 2023, however, state governments that were politically aligned with anti-vaccine activists successfully sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the Biden Administration from seeking to pressure social media companies into fighting misinformation. The order issued by United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \"severely limits the ability of the White House, the surgeon general, [and] the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention... to communicate with social media companies about content related to Covid-19... that the government views as misinformation\".[72] In October 2023, this injunction was paused by the Supreme Court of the United States, pending further litigation.[73]\n\nUse of algorithms and data [ edit ]\n\nAlgorithms and user data can be used to identify selected subgroups who can then be provided with specialized content. This type of approach has been used both by anti-vaccine activists[42][2] and by health providers who hope to counter vaccine-related disinformation.[74][75][76] For example, in the United States, the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) has been used to identify communities that have traditionally been under-served or are at elevated risk for infection, morbidity, and mortality.[74] Programs have been developed in such communities to address disinformation and vaccine hesitancy.[77]\n\nCommunity engagement [ edit ]\n\nSteps have been taken to counter anti-vaccine messaging by directly engaging with communities. Outreach efforts include call centers and texting campaigns, partnering with local community leaders, and holding community-based vaccine clinics.[77][75][78] Creating digital and science literacy resources and distributing them via schools, libraries, municipal offices, churches and other community groups can help to counter misinformation in under-resourced communities.[79]\n\nThe Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium in Philadelphia is one example of a successful direct outreach initiative.[80] Another is the New York State Vaccine Equity Task Force.[77] In line with the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE)'s 3C's model, outreach to communities has focused on addressing mistrust and increasing Confidence, providing information to improve risk assessment (Complacency), and improving access to COVID-19 vaccines (Convenience). It has been necessary to counter disinformation in all three areas.[76][77]\n\nRecommendations for combating vaccine disinformation include increasing the presence of trusted health agencies and credible information on social media, partnering with social media platforms to promote evidence-based public health information, and identifying and responding to emerging concerns and disinformation campaigns.[76] Networked communities of public health officials and other stakeholders, connecting with the public through a variety of credible and trusted messengers, are recommended. Sharing of messages through such networks could help to debunk and counter highly networked and coordinated disinformation attacks.[2]\n\nA networked community approach would differ from the current model of US public health communication, which tends to rely on a single credible messenger (e.g. Anthony Fauci) and is susceptible to disinformation attacks. To deal with disinformation, community networks would need to address issues of liberty and human rights as well as vaccine safety, effectiveness and access. Networks could also help to show support for those attacked by anti-vaccine activists.[2]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\n18th and 19th century [ edit ]\n\nIdeas that would eventually coalesce into anti-vaccine activism have existed for longer than vaccines themselves.[3] Some philosophical approaches (e.g. homeopathy, vitalism) are incompatible with the microbiological paradigm that explains how the immune system and vaccines work. Vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccine activism exist within a broader context that involves cultural tradition, religious belief, approaches to health and disease, and political affiliation.[4]\n\nOpposition to variolation for smallpox (a predecessor to vaccination) was organized as early as the 1720s around the premise that vaccination was unnatural and an attempt to thwart divine judgment.[81] Religious arguments against inoculation, the earliest arguments against vaccination, were soon advanced.[82] For example, in a 1722 sermon entitled \"The Dangerous and Sinful Practice of Inoculation\", the English theologian Reverend Edmund Massey argued that diseases are sent by God to punish sin and that any attempt to prevent smallpox via inoculation is a \"diabolical operation\".[83] It was customary at the time for popular preachers to publish sermons, which reached a wide audience. This was the case with Massey, whose sermon reached North America, where there was early religious opposition, particularly by John Williams. A greater source of opposition there was William Douglass, a medical graduate of Edinburgh University and a Fellow of the Royal Society, who had settled in Boston.[84]: 114–22\n\nJames Gillray's 1802 caricature of Jenner vaccinating patients who feared it would make them sprout cowlike appendages.\n\nVaccination itself was invented by British physician Edward Jenner, who published his findings on the efficacy of the practice for smallpox in 1798. By 1801, the practice had been widely endorsed in the scientific community, and by several world leaders. Philadelphia physician John Redman Coxe, noting that even then false accounts were circulated of negative effects of vaccination, wrote,\n\n\"Such are the falsehoods which impede the progress of the brightest discovery which has ever been made! But the contest is in vain! Time has drawn aside the veil which obstructed our knowledge of this invaluable blessing; and in the examples of the Emperor of Constantinople, of the Dowager Empress of Russia, and the King of Spain, we may date the downfall of further opposition.\"[85]\n\nCoxe's expectation of an end to opposition to vaccination proved premature, and through much of the nineteenth century, the principles, practices and impact of vaccination were matters of active scientific debate. The principles behind vaccination were not clearly understood until the end of the nineteenth century. The importance of hygiene in the preparation, storage, and administration of vaccines was not always understood or practiced. Reliable statistics on vaccine efficacy and side effects were difficult to obtain before the 1930s.[4]\n\nAnti-Compulsory Vaccination League [ edit ]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Vaccination Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. c. 100) required that every child be vaccinated within three or four months of birth.[86] It set a precedent for the state regulation of physical bodies, and was fiercely resisted.[87] The following year, in 1854, John Gibbs published the first anti-compulsory-vaccination pamphlet, Our Medical Liberties.[88] By the 1860s, anti-vaccinationism in Britain was active in the working class, labor aristocracy, and lower middle class. It had become associated with alternative medicine and was part of a larger culture of social and political dissent that included both labor unions and religious dissenters.[87][89]\n\nIn June 1867, the publication \"Human Nature\" campaigned in the United Kingdom against \"The Vaccination Humbug\",[90] reporting that many petitions had been presented to Parliament against Compulsory Vaccination for smallpox, including from parents who alleged that their children had died through the procedure, and complaining that these petitions had not been made public. The journal reported the formation of the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League \"To overthrow this huge piece of physiological absurdity and medical tyranny\", and quoted Richard Gibbs (a cousin of John Gibbs) who ran the Free Hospital at the same address as stating \"I believe we have hundreds of cases here, from being poisoned with vaccination, I deem incurable. One member of a family dating syphilitic symptoms from the time of vaccination, when all the other members of the family have been clear. We strongly advise parents to go to prison, rather than submit to have their helpless offspring inoculated with scrofula, syphilis, and mania\".[90]\n\nNotable members of the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League included James Burns, George Dornbusch and Charles Thomas Pearce.[91] After the death of Richard B. Gibbs in 1871, the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League \"languished\"[86] until 1876 when it was revived under the leadership of Mary Hume-Rothery and the Rev. W. Hume-Rothery.[92] The Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League published the Occasional Circular which later merged into the National Anti-Compulsory Vaccination Reporter.[93]\n\nAnti-Vaccination Society of America [ edit ]\n\nIn the United States, many states and local school boards established immunization requirements, beginning with a compulsory school vaccination law in Massachusetts in 1855.[88] The Anti-Vaccination Society of America was founded in 1879, after a visit to the United States by British anti-vaccine activist William Tebb,[94] and opposed compulsory smallpox vaccination for smallpox from the final decades of the 19th century through the 1910s.[95] During this period, smallpox vaccination was the only form of vaccination that was widely practiced, and the society published a periodical opposing it, called Vaccination.[96]\n\nA series of American legal cases, beginning in various states and culminating with that of Henning Jacobson of Massachusetts in 1905, upheld the mandating of compulsory smallpox vaccination for the good of the public. The court ruled in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that \"the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint. There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good\".[88]\n\nLondon Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination [ edit ]\n\n\"Death the Vaccinator\", published by the London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination in the late 1800s\n\nIn 1880, William Tebb enlarged and reorganized the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League in the UK with the formation of the London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination, with William Young as secretary.[93] The Vaccination Inquirer, established by Tebb in 1879, was adopted as the official organ of the Society.[93] A series of fourteen \"Vaccination Tracts\" was begun by Young in 1877 and completed by Garth Wilkinson in 1879. William White was the first editor of the Vaccination Inquirer and after his death in 1885, he was succeeded by Alfred Milnes.[93] Frances Hoggan and her husband authored an article for the Vaccination Inquirer in September 1883 which argued against compulsory vaccination.[97] The London Society focused on lobbying parliamentary support in the 1880s and early 1890s.[93] They gained support from several members of the House of Commons of which the most prominent was Peter Alfred Taylor, the member for Leicester, which was described as the \"Mecca of antivaccination\".[98]\n\nThe National Anti-Vaccination League [ edit ]\n\nThe UK movement grew, and as the influence of the London Society overshadowed the Hume-Rotherys and it took the national lead,[92] it was decided in February 1896 to re-form the Society as The National Anti-Vaccination League.[93] Arthur Phelps was elected as president.[93] In 1898, the league took on a school leaver named Lily Loat, who was elected as the league's Secretary by 1909.[99] In 1906, George Bernard Shaw wrote a supportive letter to the National Anti-Vaccination League, equating methods of vaccination with \"rubbing the contents of the dustpan into the wound\".[100]\n\nAnti-Vaccination League of America [ edit ]\n\nIn 1908, the Anti-Vaccination League of America was created by Charles M. Higgins and industrialist John Pitcairn Jr.,[101] with anti-vaccination campaigns focused on New York and Pennsylvania.[101] Members were opposed to compulsory vaccination laws.[102] Higgins was the League's chief spokesman and pamphleteer.[103] Historian James Colgrove noted that Higgins \"attempted to overturn the New York State's law mandating vaccination of students in public schools\".[102] The League should not be confused with the Anti-Vaccination Society of America, that was formed in 1879.[101] Higgins was criticized by medical experts for spreading misinformation and ignoring facts as to the efficacy of vaccination.[104][105] The League dissolved after the death of Higgins in 1929.[106]\n\n20th century [ edit ]\n\nAnti-vaccine activism ebbed for much of the twentieth century, but never completely vanished. In the UK, the National Anti-Vaccination League continued to publish new issues of its journal until 1972,[99] by which time the global campaign for smallpox eradication through vaccination had made the disease so uncommon that compulsory vaccination for smallpox was no longer required in the United Kingdom.[107]\n\nNew vaccines were developed and used against diseases such as diphtheria and whooping cough. In the UK, these were often introduced on a voluntary basis, without arousing the same kind of anti-vaccination response that had accompanied compulsory smallpox vaccination.[107]\n\nIn the United States, numerous measles outbreaks occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, and were shown to be more frequent in states that lacked mandatory vaccination requirements. This led to calls in the 1970s for a national level vaccination requirement for children entering schools. Joseph A. Califano Jr. appealed to state governors, and by 1980, all 50 states legally required vaccination for school entrance. Many of these laws allowed exemptions in response to lobbyists. In New York State, a 1967 law allowed exemptions from receiving polio vaccine for members of religious organizations such as Christian Scientists.[88]\n\n21st century [ edit ]\n\nLancet MMR autism fraud [ edit ]\n\nAnti-vaccine activism in the 2000s regained prominence through exploratory research by Andrew Wakefield based on 12 selected cases. He then made claims about a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.[42] These claims were subsequently extensively investigated and found to be false, and the original study turned out to be based on faked data. The scientific consensus is that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism, and that the MMR vaccine's benefits in preventing measles, mumps, and rubella greatly outweigh its potential risks.[108]\n\nThe idea of an autism link was first suggested in the early 1990s and came to public notice largely as a result of the 1998 Lancet MMR autism fraud, which Dennis K Flaherty at the University of Charleston characterized as \"perhaps the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years\".[109] The fraudulent research paper authored by Wakefield and published in The Lancet falsely claimed the vaccine was linked to colitis and autism spectrum disorders. The paper was retracted by Lancet in 2010[110] but is still cited by anti-vaccine activists.[111]\n\nThe claims in the paper were widely reported,[112] leading to a sharp drop in vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland. Promotion of the claimed link, which continued in anti-vaccination propaganda for the next three decades despite being refuted,[113][114] was estimated to have led to an increase in the incidence of measles and mumps, resulting in deaths and serious permanent injuries.[115][116] Following the initial claims in 1998, multiple large epidemiological studies were undertaken. Reviews of the evidence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[117] the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences,[118] the UK National Health Service,[119] and the Cochrane Library[108][120] all found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.[121] Physicians, medical journals, and editors[122][123][124][125][126] have described Wakefield's actions as fraudulent and tied them to epidemics and deaths.[127][128]\n\nAn investigation by journalist Brian Deer found that Wakefield, the author of the original research paper linking the vaccine to autism, had multiple undeclared conflicts of interest,[129][130] had manipulated evidence,[131] and had broken other ethical codes. After a subsequent 2.5-year investigation, the General Medical Council ruled that Wakefield had acted \"dishonestly and irresponsibly\" in doing his research, carrying out unauthorized procedures for which he was not qualified, and acting with \"callous disregard\" for the children involved.[132] Wakefield was found guilty by the General Medical Council of serious professional misconduct in May 2010, and was struck off the Medical Register, meaning he could no longer practise as a physician in the UK.[133]\n\nThe Lancet paper was partially retracted in 2004 and fully retracted in 2010, when Lancet's editor-in-chief Richard Horton described it as \"utterly false\" and said that the journal had been deceived.[134] In January 2011, Deer published a series of reports in the British Medical Journal,[135][136][137] in which a signed editorial stated of the journalist, \"It has taken the diligent scepticism of one man, standing outside medicine and science, to show that the paper was in fact an elaborate fraud.\"[138][139] A 2011 journal article described the vaccine-autism connection as \"the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years\".[121]\n\nWakefield continues to promote anti-vaccine beliefs and conspiracy theories in the United States.[140] In February 2015, Wakefield denied that he bore any responsibility for the measles epidemic that started at Disneyland among unvaccinated children that year. He also reaffirmed his discredited belief that \"MMR contributes to the current autism epidemic\".[141] By that time, at least 166 measles cases had been reported. Paul Offit disagreed, saying that the outbreak was \"directly related to Dr. Wakefield's theory\".[142] Wakefield and other anti-vaccine activists were active in the American-Somali community in Minnesota, where a drop in vaccination rates was followed by the largest measles outbreak in the state in nearly 30 years in 2017.[143][144][145]\n\nThe anti-vaccination movement was historically apolitical, but in the 2010s and 2020s the movement in the United States has increasingly targeted conservatives.[2] As measles outbreaks increased, so did calls to eliminate exemptions from vaccine administration. As of 2015, 19 American states had suggested legislation to eliminate or increase the difficulty of exemptions, including California.[88] Concurrently, American anti-vaccine activists reached out to libertarian and right-leaning groups such as the Tea Party movement to broaden their base. While earlier anti-vaccination activists focused on health impacts and safety of vaccines, recent themes increasingly involve philosophical arguments about liberty, medical freedom and parental rights.[2]\n\nWith the growing anti-vaccine movement from the 2010s onwards, the United States has seen a resurgence of certain vaccine-preventable diseases. The measles virus lost its elimination status in the US as the number of measles cases continued to rise in the late 2010s with a total of 17 outbreaks in 2018 and 465 outbreaks in 2019 (as of April 4, 2019).[146]\n\n2019 measles outbreaks [ edit ]\n\nVaccine hesitancy led to declining rates of vaccination for measles, culminating in the 2019–2020 measles outbreaks. The most significant of these in proportion to national population was the 2019 Samoa measles outbreak.[147]\n\nIn July 2018, two 12-month-old children died in Samoa after receiving incorrectly prepared MMR vaccinations.[148] These two deaths were picked up by anti-vaccine groups and used to incite fear towards vaccination on social media, causing the government to suspend its measles vaccination programme for ten months, despite advice from the WHO.[149][150] The incident caused many Samoan residents to lose trust in the healthcare system.[151] UNICEF and the World Health Organization estimate that the measles vaccination rate in Samoa fell from 74% in 2017 to 34% in 2018,[152][153] similar to some of the poorest countries in Africa.[154]\n\nIn August 2019, an infected passenger on one of the more than 8,000 annual flights between New Zealand and Samoa probably brought the disease from Auckland to Upolu.[148] A full outbreak of measles began on the island in October 2019 and continued for the next four months. As of January 6, 2020, there were over 5,700 cases of measles and 83 deaths, out of a Samoan population of 200,874.[155][156] Over three percent of the population were infected.[157] The cause of the outbreak was attributed to decreased vaccination rates, from 74% in 2017 to 31–34% in 2018, even though nearby islands had rates near 99%.[157][156] a rate of 14.3 deaths per 1000 infected) and 5,520 cases (2.75% of the population) of measles in Samoa.[158][157][156] Sixty-one out of the first 70 deaths were four years old and under, and all but seven were under 15.[159][160] After the outbreak, anti-vaxxers employed racist tropes and misinformation to credit the scores of measles deaths to poverty and poor nutrition or even to the vaccine itself, but this has been discounted by the international emergency medical support that arrived in November and December.[148] There was no evidence of acute malnutrition, clinical vitamin A deficiency, or immune deficiency as claimed by various anti-vaxxers.[148]\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic activism [ edit ]\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-vaccine activists undertook various efforts to hinder people who wanted to receive the vaccines, with such activities occurring in countries including Australia,[161] Israel,[162] the United Kingdom,[163] and the United States.[164] These included attempts to physically blockade vaccination sites, and making false reservations for vaccination appointments to clog up vaccination booking systems. Protests were also organized by the activists to raise awareness for their cause.[165]\n\nIn some instances, anti-vaccine rhetoric has been traced to state-sponsored internet troll activities designed to create social dissension.[166][167] Worldwide, foreign disinformation campaigns have been associated with declining vaccination rates in target countries.[168] Anti-vaccine activism online both before and during the pandemic has been linked to extreme levels of falsehoods, rumors, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories.[2][169][7]\n\nAnti-vaccine activists have falsely claimed in social media posts that numerous deaths or injuries had to do with reactions to vaccines. In one highly publicized instance in early 2023, after Buffalo Bills football player Damar Hamlin experienced an in-game episode of commotio cordis, there was an increase in rhetoric and disinformation from figures such as Charlie Kirk and Drew Pinsky making unfounded claims about Hamlin's cardiac arrest and COVID-19 vaccines.[170][171][172] In another 2023 incident, college basketball player Bronny James experienced cardiac arrest at the Galen Center at the University of Southern California, leading to assertions that this was a result of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine; it was later revealed that the episode had been caused by a congenital heart defect.[173] Also, anti-vaccine activists believed Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins died in 2022 from the COVID-19 vaccine, while in actuality it was a drug overdose.[174] In December 2023, The New York Times published a detailed investigation of the distortion and misrepresentation of the circumstances surrounding the death of 24-year-old George Watts Jr. by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other anti-vaccine activists.[175] Some unvaccinated persons opposed to COVID-19 vaccination began referring to themselves in social media groups as \"purebloods\", a term historically connoting racial purity.[176][177][178]\n\nProminent biomedical researcher Peter Hotez, asserted that he and other American scientists who publicly defend vaccines have been attacked on social media, harassed with threatening emails, intimidated, and confronted physically by opponents of vaccination. He further attributes the increase in aggressiveness of the anti-vaccination movement to the influence of the extreme wing of the Republican Party. Hotez estimates that roughly 200,000 preventable deaths from COVID-19, mainly among Republicans, occurred in the US because of refusal to be vaccinated.[179] A 2023 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found \"evidence of higher excess mortality for Republican voters compared with Democratic voters in Florida and Ohio after, but not before, COVID-19 vaccines were available to all adults in the US\".[180]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

    "text": "CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness program\n\nIn collaboration with public health partners, CDC evaluates vaccine effectiveness through multiple observational studies employing a variety of methods and using information collected through surveillance platforms, electronic health records, and prospective studies.\n\nSeveral factors influence vaccine effectiveness, including:\n\nhost-related factors, such as age, presence of underlying medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, cancer), and history of prior infection\n\npathogen-related factors, such as the virus variant(s) circulating\n\nvaccine-related factors, such as type of vaccine and time since vaccination\n\nCollecting information on these factors and adjusting for important epidemiologic confounders allow CDC to minimize bias in measuring vaccine effectiveness. Vaccine effectiveness can differ by the type of vaccine product, total number of vaccine doses received, and how long it has been since the most recent vaccine dose was received.\n\nVaccine effectiveness might also differ in high-risk populations, such as older individuals or those with immunocompromising conditions. To account for these differences, effectiveness estimates are often presented by age group, by presence of immunocompromising conditions, or among other populations at increased risk for severe COVID-19, such as long-term care facility residents.\n\nGuiding principles for monitoring vaccine effectiveness\n\nGoals of CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness program are to evaluate existing COVID-19 vaccines and inform decisions by the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices regarding COVID-19 vaccine policy. CDC accomplishes these goals by:\n\nAssessing COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in key populations and against key outcomes (see below). Providing timely data to evaluate effectiveness of new vaccine recommendations. Detecting changes in COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness due to waning of vaccine-induced protection and emergence of new variants Including populations at high risk for severe COVID-19 Communicating findings to policy makers, the scientific community, the public, and other stakeholders\n\nOutcomes of interest for vaccine policy\n\nPreventing severe COVID-19 is the priority for the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program. CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness program monitors several patient-important outcomes in the evaluations it conducts to generate evidence most relevant for COVID-19 vaccine policy:\n\nCritical illness or death due to COVID-19\n\nHospitalization for COVID-19\n\nMedically attended COVID-19 (e.g., urgent care and emergency department visits)\n\nSymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nTerms for vaccine effectiveness\n\nVaccine effectiveness is a measure of how well vaccination protects people against health outcomes such as infection, symptomatic illness, hospitalization, and death. Vaccine effectiveness is generally measured by comparing the frequency of health outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated people.\n\nAbsolute vaccine effectiveness is a term that can be applied when the study compares vaccinated people to unvaccinated people.\n\nRelative vaccine effectiveness is the term used when the study measures vaccine effectiveness by comparing people who have received one vaccine type or regimen to those who received a different vaccine type or regimen.\n\nIncremental vaccine effectiveness refers to measures that compare people who received more doses with those who received fewer doses.\n\nMeasuring relative and incremental vaccine effectiveness can help vaccine policy makers decide whether people who have already been vaccinated might benefit from receiving an extra dose or another vaccine product.",

    "text": "People who received the updated COVID-19 vaccine were 54% less likely to get COVID-19 during the four-month period from mid-September 2023 to January 2024.\n\nSummary What CDC knows New CDC data show that the updated COVID-19 vaccines were effective against COVID-19 during September 2023 – January 2024, including against the different circulating virus variants such as JN.1 and XBB. Getting vaccinated now can help lower the risk of becoming infected with or dying from COVID-19. CDC recommends everyone 6 months or older receive the updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine. What CDC is doing CDC analyzes circulating variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 and assesses how well COVID-19 vaccines protect people. We do this by looking at vaccine effectiveness against infection with symptoms or against severe disease, including hospitalization and death. Through CDC's Bridge Access Program, COVID-19 vaccines are available at no cost to people who are uninsured or underinsured.\n\nUpdated COVID-19 vaccine boosts waning immunity The virus that causes COVID-19 is always changing, and protection from infection or COVID-19 vaccination declines over time. Receiving an updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine can restore and provide enhanced protection against the variants currently responsible for most infections and hospitalizations in the United States. New data from CDC show that the updated COVID-19 vaccines were effective against COVID-19 during September 2023 – January 2024, including against variants from the XBB lineage, which is included in the updated vaccine, and JN.1, a new variant that has become dominant in recent weeks.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 will continue to evolve For viruses to survive they must continually make copies of themselves and infect new cells. Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, will continue to evolve because it makes errors, or mutations, when it is creating copies. Some mutations help the virus survive better or spread more easily, leading to different variants over time. During the analysis period, many different variants were infecting people.\n\nUpdated COVID-19 vaccine protects against many variants CDC data show that vaccination offered significant protection. People who received the updated COVID-19 vaccine were 54% less likely to get COVID-19 during the four-month period from mid-September to January. The vaccine provided similar levels of protection against XBB lineage variants and the JN.1 variant. To estimate vaccine effectiveness of the updated COVID-19 vaccine, CDC analyzed data from the Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) COVID-19 pharmacy testing program. The protection provided by the updated vaccine was compared to not receiving an updated vaccine, regardless of a person's infection history or the number of previous COVID-19 vaccines they received. That means these estimates reflect the additional protection provided by getting an updated COVID-19 vaccine dose above protection that people have from any previous vaccination, infection, or both.\n\nSince protection from prior infections and vaccinations declines over time, stay up to date on vaccines The updated COVID-19 vaccines have been available since mid-September, so these estimates only include data from the 4 months since the updated vaccine became available. Protection against COVID-19 from earlier versions of the COVID-19 vaccine decreased over several months after vaccination. Based on that, we expect that protection from the updated vaccine will also decline over time. The same is true for the protection derived from infection. However, most people who are vaccinated and those who had COVID-19 will have some protection from future severe COVID-19. Although the amount and duration of protection from vaccination or infection can vary from person to person, CDC data have demonstrated that original COVID-19 vaccines can help protect against being put on a ventilator and/or death for up to 2 years and bivalent COVID-19 vaccines also provide sustained protection against critical illness and death. Even with this sustained protection it is important that you get your updated COVID-19 vaccine since it can provide additional protection. Additional vaccine effectiveness data against emergency department/urgent care visits and hospitalizations will be shared as they become available. CDC recommends everyone 6 months or older get an updated COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccination remains the best protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. Vaccination also reduces your chance of suffering the effects of Long COVID, which can develop during or following acute infection and last for an extended duration.",

    "text": "Christopher Dye , professor of epidemiology Department of Biology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK christopher.dye{at}zoo.ox.ac.uk\n\nNew evidence confirms that fewer people die in better vaccinated communities\n\nThe first covid-19 vaccines were administered under emergency use authorisation in December 2020, just one year into the pandemic, a “miracle” of pharmaceutical innovation that has saved an estimated million lives or more in the US alone.12 The authorisation was given on the basis of safety and efficacy in randomised controlled trials, which found that immunisation with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines protected a remarkably high percentage (>90%) of recipients from developing symptomatic infection and, to a lesser extent, from asymptomatic infection too. In other words, when tested against the SARS-CoV-2 variants prevailing in 2020 and early 2021, these novel covid-19 vaccines could stop the great majority of infections from causing illness and help to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. But could vaccination prevent infection and illness on a large scale, outside the controlled environment of clinical trials? A linked study by Suthar and colleagues (doi:10.1136/bmj-2021-069317) adds to the evidence that it can, across the US.3\n\nGiven the practical challenges of scaling up immunisation programmes—maintaining cold chains, carrying out mass inoculation in busy or makeshift clinics, and accurately reporting both numbers vaccinated and health outcomes—real world vaccine effectiveness is typically less than the efficacy achieved in clinical trials. Following reports that effectiveness has remained high for a variety of outcomes (infection, symptomatic illness, visits to emergency departments, hospital admissions, severe illness, and death) in diverse settings,45678910 Suthar and colleagues have now investigated the impact of covid-19 vaccination, largely with Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, across 2558 counties in 48 US states, covering nearly 80% of the US population. Their evaluation is based on more than 30 million cases of covid-19 and more than 400 000 deaths linked to covid-19, which were reported during the second year of the pandemic, between December 2020 and December 2021.3\n\nThey measured effectiveness by comparing reported covid-19 incidence and mortality rates in counties with very low (0-9%), low (10-39%), medium (40-69%), and high (≥70%) percentages of adults (≥18 years) who had received at least one dose of vaccine. During the first half of 2021, when the alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 was dominant, the covid-19 mortality rate was reduced by 60%, 75%, and 81% in counties with low, medium, and high vaccination coverage, compared with counties that had very low coverage. The corresponding figures for the reduction in case incidence were 57%, 70%, and 80%. The impact on mortality was similar during the second half of 2021 when the delta variant became dominant in the US, with smaller effects on incidence.3\n\nClearly, counties with higher vaccination coverage had fewer covid-19 cases and deaths per head of population, and the measured effectiveness in counties with high vaccine coverage was reassuringly large. More than this, vaccination had a disproportionately large effect in counties with low and medium coverage. For instance, an incremental increase in coverage of only 20% (from very low to low) and 50% (from very low to medium) led to reductions in mortality of 60% and 75%, respectively.\n\nSuthar and colleagues argue that vaccination benefits whole communities, and indeed it does when coverage is high.3 But they did not seek, and their data do not show, any extra effect of herd immunity, whereby vaccinated people prevented the transmission of infection to others in their communities.11 A more likely explanation for the disproportionately beneficial effect in counties with low and medium coverage is that vaccination campaigns first targeted older people who are at greatest risk of severe illness and death from covid-19. Vaccine rollout in most countries began with older and otherwise vulnerable people and progressively included younger and less vulnerable people. Hong Kong is a notable exception, where high covid-19 death rates in March 2022 were associated with low vaccination rates particularly among older people.12 Unlike Hong Kong, the US has followed the norm: in states that have achieved relatively low vaccination coverage overall, the percentage of older people vaccinated is invariably higher than the population average.13 Suthar and colleagues did not investigate the effect of vaccination by age, but doing this should be possible with existing data available to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe findings of this study also make clear that many more lives could have been saved, and will be saved, by encouraging people to keep up to date with vaccination in the face of waning immunity and new SARS-CoV-2 variants and by achieving even higher population coverage. How many lives is a matter for others to explore. Meanwhile, this new study is another confidence booster for covid-19 vaccines.\n\nFootnotes Competing interests: The BMJ has judged that there are no disqualifying financial ties to commercial companies.

    "title": "The efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines around the world: a mini-review and meta-analysis - Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials",
    "text": "Since the emergence of COVID-19, the effort to develop effective vaccines against the infection has been started. Due to the highly contagious nature of the virus, vaccination has been considered a significant measure in the fight against COVID-19. World Health Organization (WHO) allows countries to issue emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines in line with their national regulations and legislation. Domestic emergency use authorizations are issued at the countries’ discretion and are not subject to WHO approval. Up to now, several vaccines have been developed and marketed to limit the spread of COVID-19 infection. As of January 12, 2022, several COVID 19 vaccines have been given Emergency Use Listing (EUL), including those developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Bharat Biotech, etc. [29].\n\nDespite the significant role of COVID-19 vaccination in confining the infection, vaccines’ Efficacy and Effectiveness have not yet been comprehensively discussed. The present study meticulously looked into the Efficacy and Effectiveness of several vaccines.\n\nOur analysis revealed that the overall effectiveness of the studied vaccines after the first dose is significantly less than their effectiveness after the second dose. The first dose’s effectiveness was evaluated in 17 studies. After the first dose, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer’s Effectiveness was 74%, 69%, and 67%, respectively. The Effectiveness of Moderna after the first dose was higher than other types of studied vaccines. Second dose Effectiveness was evaluated in 17 studies. After the second dose of Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer vaccination, the effectiveness was 93%, 89%, and 90, respectively. Moderna provided higher effectiveness after the second dose among other studied vaccines. Therefore, administering the second dose should produce a more reliable response and higher effectiveness than a single dose.\n\nSurprisingly, the overall efficacy of the first dose was significantly more than the second dose; 81% (95% CI 0.70, 0.91) for the first dose compared to 71% (95% CI 0.62, 0.79) for the second dose. This can be explained by the fact that the efficacy after the first dose was evaluated only in 8 studies that assessed only AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. No data was available regarding the efficacy after the first dose of Moderna, Bharat, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. We observed that the first dose Efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine is significantly more than the AstraZeneca vaccine. The Efficacy for AstraZeneca and Pfizer after the first dose vaccination was 78% and 84%, respectively. Concerning the second dose Efficacy, the published data were available only for AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Bharat. In Total, eighteen studies evaluated the efficacy of these vaccines after the second dose. The Efficacy for AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Bharat was 67%, 93%, and 71%, respectively.\n\nWe also investigated the Efficacy and Effectiveness of the first and second-dose vaccination against the COVID-19 virus variants. The overall efficacy of vaccination against the Alfa variant after the first dose was 84%, which was more than other variants. The highest efficacy after the second dose vaccination was also observed for the Alpha variant (77%). The first dose’s effectiveness against the Gamma variant was the highest (74%). Although, the overall first dose effectiveness was 82%. The highest second dose Effectiveness was against the Beta variant (96%), and the overall effectiveness after the second vaccination dose was 96% against all variants.\n\nUp to now, there are other meta-analyses published on the efficacy and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, in the meta-analysis reported by Pormohammad et., al, the efficacy of mRNA-based and adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines in phase II/III randomized clinical trial has been reported as 94.6% (95% CI 0.936–0.954) and 80.2% (95% CI 0.56–0.93), respectively. Additionally, the mRNA-based vaccines showed the highest reported side effects except for diarrhea and arthralgia [30]. However, the research had not reported the efficacy against different variants of the COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the Efficacy and Effectiveness of individual vaccines have not been mentioned; the vaccine Efficacy has been reported based on the vaccine classes. Another meta-analysis reported that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was 91.2% and 98.1%, respectively, while the effectiveness of the CoronaVac vaccine was 65.7% in fully vaccinated individuals [31]. However, this study has not reported the effectiveness of the vaccines against COVID-19 variants or their efficacy.\n\nAdditionally, A previously reported network meta-analysis of various COVID-19 vaccines found Moderna was the most effective vaccine against COVID-19 infection, with an efficacy rate of 88%, followed by Sinopharm and Bharat. The least effective vaccines were Coronavac, Curevac, and AstraZeneca. The mRNA-based vaccines were superior in preventing infection and symptomatic infection, while the inactivated vaccines were most effective in preventing severe COVID-19 infection. Concerning safety, Sinopharm had the highest safety profile in local side effects, while ZF2001 had the highest safety in unsolicited side effects. Inactivated vaccines had the best safety profile in local and systemic side effects, while mRNA-based vaccines had the poorest safety profile. Thromboembolic events were reported after J&J, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna vaccine administration. However, no confirmed vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) cases were reported after mRNA vaccines [32].\n\nIt is necessary to mention that some vaccines’ overall or variant-specific Effectiveness and Efficacy are unavailable after the first or second dose. Moreover, the timing of the second dosing of the vaccines is not elicited in some trials, which may have led to the lower observed overall efficacy after the second dose. Additionally, some reports had noticeable bias by not including enough samples or not considering a broad enough geographical, economic, and age diversity.\n\nWe searched various databases and websites to include the maximum number of relevant publications to prevent database bias; after performing Egger’s regression test, we did not find significant publication bias. However, publication bias and heterogeneity for some pooled results must be considered when interpreting the outcomes.\n\nDespite the valuable information provided by this meta-analysis, the study has some limitations to consider, such as the time frame of the studies (November 2020 to April 2022), the exclusion of unpublished data or ongoing investigations, the subjectivity of study selection criteria, and the limited number of vaccines evaluated. Additionally, the study did not consider differences in vaccine distribution among countries or provide data on the vaccines’ effectiveness against severe disease, hospitalization, or death. Despite its limitations, the meta-analysis highlights the need to continue monitoring the vaccines’ effectiveness.",

    "title": "Comparative efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in phase III trials: a network meta-analysis - BMC Infectious Diseases",
    "text": "A total of 5606 records were identified by the search, with 24 published and one unpublished Phase III RCT [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45] involving 22 vaccines eventually included in the NMA (Fig. 1). Two of the search results included a small number of individuals under the age of 18 years [29, 31], and another study included Phase I/II/III RCTs of AZD1222 vaccines [34]. These three studies were included in the NMA to ensure a sufficient number of samples. None of the included studies directly compared two different vaccines. In total, 915,370 participants were included, and more than 50% were randomly assigned for vaccination. Study characteristics and raw data are summarized in Table 1 and S2. A comparison of basic features, including outcome definition and participant characteristics (age, sex, and race) is presented in Table S3 and Figure S1. There was no evidence of violation of the transitivity assumption. Among these articles, studies with some concerns accounted for 36%, but there were no serious risks of bias according to the RoB2 (Figure S2).\n\nFig. 1 Flowchart of study selection Full size image\n\nTable 1 Characteristics of the clinical studies included in the network meta-analysis Full size table\n\nComparative efficacy and safety of different types of vaccines in adults\n\nWe explored the differences in efficacy and safety between different types of vaccines using NMA. Vaccines were divided into five categories: inactivated viral vaccines, mRNA vaccines, DNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and protein subunit vaccines. Star-shaped network diagrams of the primary outcomes are shown in Fig. 2(A) and S3.\n\nFig. 2 Network diagram (A) Network diagram of type-specific efficacy for adults. (B) Network diagram of individual vaccine efficacy for adults. The thickness of the lines is proportional to the number of trials comparing every pair of treatments Full size image\n\nThe inactivated viral, mRNA, viral vector, and protein subunit vaccines were predictably more effective than the placebo in terms of efficacy (25 RCTs involving 22 vaccines), with RRs ranging between 0.13 (95% CI [0.05, 0.31]) for mRNA vaccines and 0.28 [0.16, 0.49] for inactivated viral vaccines (Fig. 3(A)). The DNA vaccines (0.32 [0.07, 1.5]) were not statistically significant compared with the placebo. There were no significant differences between the various types of vaccines in the indirect pairwise comparisons (Table S4), although there was a trend in the mRNA vaccines for the lowest risk of symptomatic disease, with the lowest SUCRA value of 0.09 (Table S5).\n\nFig. 3 Forest plot of intervention compared to the placebo in the network meta-analysis. RR, risk ratio; CI, confidence interval. (A) Forest plot of the efficacy of different vaccine types in adults. (B) Forest plot of the safety of different vaccine types in adults. (C) Forest plot of individual vaccine efficacy for adults. (D) Forest plot of individual vaccine safety for adults. (E) Forest plot of efficacy of different vaccine types in the elderly. (F) Forest plot of individual vaccine efficacy for the elderly Full size image\n\nIn terms of safety (21 RCTs involving 19 vaccines), none of vaccines had a higher incidence of SAEs than the placebo (Fig. 3(B)). The inactivated virus vaccine ranked first, with a SUCRA value of 0.04, whereas the mRNA vaccine ranked last, with a SUCRA value of 0.98 (Table S6). There was a significant difference in the side effect rates between mRNA vaccines and other vaccine types in the indirect pairwise comparisons (Table S7). Funnel plots and Egger’s tests revealed asymmetry in VE and no asymmetry in vaccine safety (Figure S4).\n\nComparative efficacy and safety of individual vaccines in adults\n\nNetwork diagrams are shown in Fig. 2(B) and S5. In terms of efficacy (25 RCTs involving 22 vaccines), all 22 vaccines were more effective than the placebo, with RRs ranging between 0.05 [0.02, 0.09] for BNT162b2 and 0.64 [0.52, 0.79] for SpikoGen (Fig. 3(C)). According to the outcome of pairwise comparisons (Table S8) and SUCRA value (Table S9), BNT162b2 had the highest efficacy (SUCRA value: 0.02), followed by mRNA-1273, Abdala, Gam-COVID-Vac, and NVX-CoV2373. The efficacy of SpikoGen was the lowest, with a SUCRA of 0.94.\n\nIn terms of safety (21 RCTs involving 19 vaccines), none of the vaccines had a higher incidence of SAEs than the placebo (Fig. 3(D)). BIV1-CovIran had the highest probability of being the vaccine with the lowest incidence of SAEs (SUCRA value: 0.1), followed by BBV152, Soberana, Gam-COVID-Vac, and ZF2001. In contrast, the safety of CoVLP + AS03 was the lowest, with a SUCRA value of 0.89. There were no statistically significant differences between most of the vaccines. Details of the pairwise comparisons and SUCRA values are shown in Tables S10 and S11.\n\nComparative efficacy of different types of vaccines in the elderly population\n\nData on efficacy in the elderly population were retrieved from 15 RCTs involving 14 vaccines. Vaccines are divided into four categories: inactivated virus vaccines, mRNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and protein subunit vaccines. The definition of the elderly population slightly differed across the included studies, ranging from 50 to 65 years. Star-shaped network diagram is shown in Figures S6.\n\nThe mRNA, viral vector, and protein subunit vaccines were predictably more effective than the placebo, with RRs ranging from 0.18 [0.05, 0.67] for mRNA vaccines and 0.23 [0.07, 0.75] for protein subunit vaccines (Fig. 3(E)). The inactivated virus vaccine (0.4 [0.1, 1.5]) was not statistically significant compared to the placebo. There were no significant differences between the various types of vaccines in the indirect pairwise comparisons (Table S12), although there was a trend in the mRNA vaccine for the lowest risk of symptomatic disease, with the lowest SUCRA value of 0.24 (Table S13). Funnel plots and Egger’s tests indicated no publication bias (Figure S7).\n\nComparative efficacy of individual vaccines in the elderly population\n\nStar-shaped network diagram is shown in Figures S8. 11 of the 14 vaccines had good preventive effects against COVID-19 compared with the placebo, with RRs ranging between 0.06 [0.01, 0.16] for BNT162b2 and 0.48 [0.21, 0.99] for Ad5-nCoV (Fig. 3(F)). CVnCoV, CoVLP + AS03, and CoronaVac were interpreted as having no differences from the placebo. BNT162b2 had the lowest SUCRA value of 0.08, with the highest probability of being the most effective vaccine for the elderly, followed by Gam-COVID-Vac and mRNA-1273, whereas CVnCoV had the lowest probability, with the highest SUCRA value of 0.92. Details of the SUCRA values and pairwise comparisons are shown in Tables S14 and S15.\n\nAdditional analyses\n\nSensitive analyses were performed after excluded trials with a follow-up time of less than 2 months. 18 RCTs were included in analyses. The results were stable and were similar to the main analysis after excluding 7 trials (Table S16). In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed after excluded the unpublished study, and the results are robust.",

    "title": "COVID-19 Vaccine Basics",
    "text": "Overview Did you know? COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future. It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes. Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal signs the body is building immunity.\n\nTypes of vaccines Available Vaccines There are different types of vaccines. All COVID-19 vaccines prompt our bodies to recognize and help protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nCurrently, there are two types of COVID-19 vaccines for use in the United States: mRNA, and protein subunit vaccines. None of these vaccines can give you COVID-19. Vaccines do not use any live virus.\n\nVaccines cannot cause infection with the virus that causes COVID-19 or other viruses. COVID-19 vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA. These vaccines do not enter the nucleus of the cell where our DNA (genetic material) is located, so they cannot change or influence our genes. mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) To trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies. Not mRNA vaccines. Instead, mRNA vaccines use mRNA created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. This immune response, which produces antibodies, is what helps protect us from getting sick from that germ in the future. How mRNA COVID-19 vaccines work First, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle or upper thigh, depending on the age of who is getting vaccinated.\n\nAfter vaccination, the mRNA will enter the muscle cells. Once inside, they use the cells’ machinery to produce a harmless piece of what is called the spike protein. The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After the protein piece is made, our cells break down the mRNA and remove it, leaving the body as waste.\n\nNext, our cells display the spike protein piece on their surface. Our immune system recognizes that the protein does not belong there. This triggers our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19.\n\nAt the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to help protect against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The benefit is that people get this protection from a vaccine, without ever having to risk the potentially serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19. Any side effects from getting the vaccine are normal signs the body is building protection. How mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Work How mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Work PDF infographic English [128 KB, 1 page] Other Languages Show Text Description Research for mRNA technology Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades. In fact, mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV).\n\nBeyond vaccines, cancer research has also used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells. Protein subunit vaccines (Novavax) Protein subunit vaccines contain pieces (proteins) of the virus that causes COVID-19. These virus pieces are the spike protein. The vaccine also contains another ingredient called an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to that spike protein in the future. Once the immune system knows how to respond to the spike protein, the immune system will be able to respond quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect you against COVID-19. How protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work Protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle. After vaccination, nearby cells pick up these proteins.\n\nNext, our immune system recognizes that these proteins do not belong there. Another ingredient in the vaccine, the adjuvant, helps our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19.\n\nAt the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to help protect against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The benefit is that people get this protection from a vaccine, without ever having to risk the potentially serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19.

How Protein Subunit COVID-19 Vaccines Work How Protein Subunit COVID-19 Vaccines Work PDF infographic English [953 KB, 1 page] Show Text Description Research for protein subunit technology Protein subunit vaccines have been used for years. More than 30 years ago, a hepatitis B vaccine became the first protein subunit vaccine to be approved for use in people in the United States.\n\nto be approved for use in people in the United States. Another example of protein subunit vaccines used today include whooping cough vaccines.",

    "title": "FDA scrutiny of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine sparks uncertainty about other shots",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration’s effort to impose new requirements on Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine — the nation’s only traditional protein-based option for the coronavirus — is sowing uncertainty about updates to other vaccines, too.\n\nNovavax said Monday that the Food and Drug Administration was asking the company to run a new clinical trial of its vaccine after the agency grants full approval. The company said it had responded and that it believed its shot remains “approvable.”\n\nBut a weekend post on social media by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested the prospect of needing a new trial before the shots’ yearly strain update — something unlikely to be possible before fall. That’s raised questions about whether other vaccines will be caught in the turmoil.\n\n“I don’t think because there’s a strain change that this is a new product,” said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief. If that’s the new policy, “you’d always be doing clinical trials and you’d never have a vaccine that was up to date.”\n\nThe unusual move at FDA come shortly after the agency’s longtime vaccine chief was forced out over disagreements with Makary’s boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nKennedy won Senate confirmation to his job, in part, by promising not to change the nation’s vaccine schedule. Since taking office, he’s promised to “investigate” children’s shots, canceled meetings of expert vaccine advisers and directed officials to look again for connections between vaccines and autism, a link long-ago debunked.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine, which originally showed effectiveness in a nearly 30,000-person clinical trial, is still being sold under emergency use authorization in the U.S. The nation’s other two options, mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, have earned full FDA approval for certain age groups.\n\nBecause the coronavirus continually mutates, manufacturers follow instructions from FDA to make one change each year to their recipe — which strain to target — just like flu vaccines.\n\nThe FDA was on track to grant Novavax full approval by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters. But Trump appointees directed FDA scientists to pause their decision, according to one of the people. Since that highly unusual move, Novavax and the agency have been discussing additional requirements for approval.\n\nIn his weekend tweet, FDA’s Makary referred to the Novavax vaccine as “a new product,” presumably because it had been updated to match last year’s common coronavirus strain.\n\n“New products require new clinical studies,” Makary added.\n\nAn administration spokesman didn’t respond to specific questions about Pfizer and Moderna but suggested all COVID-19 vaccines could face stricter requirements.\n\n“It’s now been years since COVID has presented the threat it once did, and the urgency to rush approval of boosters without normal oversight no longer exists,” said Andrew Nixon, a Health and Human Services spokesman, in a statement.\n\nThe FDA had been treating the annual COVID-19 strain updates exactly as it’s done for decades with flu vaccines — not as new products, but existing ones that are merely adjusted to protect against the latest strains, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nOffit said the companies still must perform tests in small numbers of people that show these updated vaccines produce levels of virus-fighting antibodies known to be protective, and they’re closely monitored for safety.\n\nNixon, the HHS spokesman, suggested the policy might not apply to the flu shot, “which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years.”\n\nUnder federal law, the FDA is required to follow established procedures when issuing requirements to drugmakers for approval. If the agency skips certain steps or imposes additional requirements for political reasons, experts say, it could be sued by drugmakers — or even patients, such as those who prefer the Novavax vaccine over its competitors because of an allergy or some other reason.\n\nIn addition to large clinical trials conducted before all three COVID-19 vaccines were cleared for use, there’s data on real-world use, said former Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, who oversaw COVID-19 vaccine policy during the Biden administration.\n\n“At the point where I had left, we had put some 700 million COVID vaccines into the arms of Americans,” he said. “That’s a pretty good size clinical trial.”\n\n___\n\nAP writer Amanda Seitz contributed to this story\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "title": "After Missed Decision Deadline, Novavax Says COVID-19 Shot ‘Approvable’",
    "text": "Novavax believes the application for its COVID-19 vaccine is “approvable,” the company announced on Wednesday, citing “conversations” it’s had with the FDA over the last few weeks.\n\nIn its press announcement, Novavax revealed that the FDA has issued a formal request, asking the company for a so-called postmarketing commitment to generate “additional clinical data” for the COVID-19 shot. BioSpace has reached out to Novavax and will update this story accordingly.\n\nNovavax’s shares surged nearly 20% on Wednesday following the news.\n\nUnlike postmarketing requirements, which companies must comply with after a product approval, postmarketing commitments are not required by any statute or regulation. Companies instead have to agree to run these post-approval studies and trials to collect further information on their product and provide better clarity on its safety and efficacy.\n\nNovavax will work to address the FDA’s request “expeditiously” and push the vaccine candidate to approval “as soon as possible,” according to its press release.\n\nWednesday’s announcement comes after Novavax earlier this month confirmed that the FDA had missed its deadline for releasing a verdict on the investigational COVID-19 shot. At the time, Politico reported that the agency’s principal deputy commissioner Sara Brenner directly intervened in the review, though the regulator did not provide a justification for her actions.\n\n“We had responded to all of the FDA’s information requests,” Novavax said at the time. “We continue to wait on action from the agency and have not yet received an official decision from the U.S. FDA.”\n\nThough the U.S. has declared that the pandemic’s public health emergency over, COVID-19 has been making headlines again, driven in large part by recent policy changes under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. On Tuesday, for instance, Politico reported that Kennedy was thinking about removing COVID-19 from the government’s immunization guidelines for kids. This move would align with recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met last week.\n\nThe HHS, under Kennedy, has also pulled funding for at least two COVID-19 vaccines in development. In February, the Department issued a stop order for a multimillion-dollar contract with Vaxart for an oral COVID-19 vaccine. The suspension, which will last for 90 days, will give government reviewers time to assess Vaxart’s data. Earlier this month, the government similarly froze funding for GeoVax’s work on a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nOn a broader scale, Kennedy is also considering sweeping changes to how the U.S. monitors side effects associated with vaccines. In an event earlier this month, he blasted the current practice, saying that “it’s outrageous that we don’t have a surveillance system that functions,” referring to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, which has been running since 1990. Kennedy’s planned changes could include “automated adverse event reporting.”",

(Nasdaq: GOVX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing vaccines and immunotherapies for infectious diseases and cancer, today recapped the successful presentation of new clinical data on its multi-antigen SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, GEO-CM04S1, delivered at the 25th Annual World Vaccine Congress in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe presentation, titled “Phase 2b Study Results That Evaluated and Compared GeoVax’s Multi-Antigen Vaccine Candidate (GEO-CM04S1) to an Approved Vaccine Against COVID-19,” was given by Don J. Diamond, Ph.D. on April 24, 2025. It highlighted results across several Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, including studies involving healthy volunteers as well as immunocompromised patients such as stem cell transplant recipients and those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).\n\nGEO-CM04S1, based on the synthetic Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector platform, uniquely expresses both the Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) antigens of SARS-CoV-2 - resulting in broad and durable immune responses even in populations that have historically responded poorly to mRNA vaccines.\n\nKey Highlights from the Clinical Data Presented\n\nRobust Immune Response in Healthy Adults\n\nIn a Phase 1 trial, 100% of participants (34/34) seroconverted (i.e., produced antibodies) for Spike IgG, and 94% (32/34) for Nucleocapsid IgG.\n\n98% (48/49) demonstrated a T cell response to either antigen following vaccination.\n\nNo serious safety concerns were reported across varying dose levels.\n\nComparable Immunogenicity at Lower Doses (Phase 2 Booster Trial)\n\nHealthy volunteers who had previously received mRNA or protein-based COVID-19 vaccines were boosted with GEO-CM04S1 at two dose levels (10⁷ vs 10⁸ pfu).\n\nSpike, RBD, and Nucleocapsid IgG antibody responses, as well as neutralization titers against multiple COVID-19 variants (including XBB.1.5), increased significantly at both dose levels with no meaningful differences between them.\n\nT cell responses increased significantly post-vaccination, regardless of baseline immunity.\n\nSuperior Performance in Immunocompromised Populations\n\nIn stem cell transplant recipients, GEO-CM04S1 induced ELISA antibody titers and T cell responses that exceeded those observed in healthy volunteers.\n\nIn a randomized Phase 2 trial comparing GEO-CM04S1 to the Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty®) vaccine in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, GEO-CM04S1 demonstrated a significantly higher T cell response rate. At Day 56 of the study: 6 of 15 patients in the GEO-CM04S1 arm achieved ≥3-fold increases in Spike or Nucleocapsid-specific T cells versus 2 of 14 in the Comirnaty arm. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended halting enrollment in the Pfizer arm due to underperformance, while continuing enrollment of the GEO-CM04S1 arm.\n\n\n\n“We were pleased to share these promising results with global leaders in vaccinology,” said Don J. Diamond, Ph.D. “The data underscore the value of our dual-antigen approach, particularly for patients underserved by existing single-antigen vaccines. GEO-CM04S1 not only drives strong antibody and T cell immunity in healthy adults, but also in the immunocompromised - a population historically underserved by single-antigen mRNA vaccines.”\n\nDavid A. Dodd, Chairman, President, and CEO of GeoVax, added: “The clinical performance of GEO-CM04S1 across diverse and high-risk populations supports our mission to deliver broad and lasting protection through next-generation vaccines. Our data continues to demonstrate strong, durable immune responses in both healthy and immunocompromised populations - a critical feature of our vaccine for public health preparedness. As we continue to advance this program, these results reinforce our confidence in the MVA platform as a foundation for addressing future public health threats.”\n\nAbout GEO-CM04S1\n\nGEO-CM04S1 is a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector originally developed at City of Hope. Its multi-antigen design expresses both Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2, promoting broad, cross-reactive immunity. The vaccine is being evaluated in three ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials.\n\nAbout GeoVax\n\nGeoVax Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel vaccines against infectious diseases and therapies for solid tumor cancers.

    "text": "Why get vaccinated against COVID-19?\n\nThe emergency phase of COVID-19 is over, but the virus continues to spread widely across the globe and endanger people's lives, particularly those who are older, have chronic diseases, are immunocompromised or pregnant.\n\nSafe and effective vaccines help ensure that COVID-19 does not result in severe disease and death. In 2021 alone, COVID-19 vaccines saved at least an estimated 14.4 million lives worldwide.\n\nCheck your COVID-19 vaccination status and consult with your healthcare provider for any needed doses.\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are safe.\n\nStrict precautions are in place to help ensure the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nBefore receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies, COVID-19 vaccines were subject to rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy.\n\nUnprecedented scientific collaborations, extensive prior research and substantial public funding enabled swift COVID-19 vaccine development to be completed in record time – while maintaining high safety standards. New versions of the vaccine are being developed as the COVID-19 virus continues to circulate and change.\n\nSince 2021, more than 13 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered globally. As with all vaccines, WHO and regulatory authorities continuously monitor the use of COVID-19 vaccines to identify and respond to any safety issues that might arise. Serious reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are extremely rare. Through this process, we establish that COVID-19 vaccines remain safe worldwide.\n\nRead more on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines:\n\nWho should get vaccinated?\n\nIn September 2024, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group on Immunization (SAGE) reaffirmed the validity of its recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination and the importance of revaccination for groups at higher risk of severe disease and death (older adults, people iwht comorbidities, immunocompromised individuals and pregnant persons). Revaccination of health workers is also recommended.\n\nThe table below outlines the updated recommendations based on a person’s (1) vaccination history and (2) age and health condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting vaccinated: Specific advice\n\nTake whatever vaccine is made available to you , even if you have already had COVID-19. Hybrid immunity (protection from both vaccination and COVID-19 infection) enhances protection against severe disease of future COVID-19 infections and confers longer protection.\n\nRevaccination approximately 12 months after the previous dose is particularly important for those groups at higher risk of severe disease and mortality (older adults, people with chronic diseases, pregnant persons, immunocompromised persons) and health workers.\n\n\n\n, even if you have already had COVID-19. Hybrid immunity (protection from both vaccination and COVID-19 infection) enhances protection against severe disease of future COVID-19 infections and confers longer protection. If you are pregnant, want to get pregnant in the future or are currently breastfeeding, getting vaccinated is important to protect you and your family. Many people around the world have now been vaccinated against COVID-19 while pregnant or breastfeeding, and no safety concerns have been identified for them or their babies.\n\n\n\n\n\nA single dose during pregnancy is recommended, regardless of prior vaccination. Read more: COVID-19 Q&A: Pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period.\n\nIt is safe and effective to receive different COVID-19 vaccines and to co-administer other vaccines during the same visit; for example, with other vaccines recommended during pregnancy such as the seasonal influenza vaccine.\n\nYou should not be vaccinated if: You have a history of severe allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to any of the ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine. You have a fever over 38.5ºC on the day of your vaccine appointment. Postpone until you have recovered.\n\nIf you are on blood thinners, it is safe for you to get vaccinated, but let the person vaccinating know.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect after getting vaccinated",

    "title": "Exploring the binding efficacy of ivermectin against the key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis: an in silico approach",
    "text": "Abstract Aim: COVID-19 is currently the biggest threat to mankind. Recently, ivermectin (a US FDA-approved antiparasitic drug) has been explored as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. Herein, we have studied the possible mechanism of action of ivermectin using in silico approaches. Materials & methods: Interaction of ivermectin against the key proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis were investigated through molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation. Results: Ivermectin was found as a blocker of viral replicase, protease and human TMPRSS2, which could be the biophysical basis behind its antiviral efficiency. The antiviral action and ADMET profile of ivermectin was on par with the currently used anticorona drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. Conclusion: Our study enlightens the candidature of ivermectin as an effective drug for treating COVID-19. Keywords: : ivermectin, molecular docking, protease, replicase, SARS-CoV-2, spike glycoprotein\n\nThe Coronaviridae family of viruses has engraved its name in history by cursing humankind with three major blows – the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV, and the latest pandemic outbreak in the form of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 [1]. Hitherto, there are over 21.29 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, which has already taken 0.76 million lives till the mid of August 2020 [2]. The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-Coronavirus genus of a 2B group of the Coronaviridae family. This viral strain consists of four major structural proteins such as S protein, which encompasses the spike, E forming the envelope, M for the membrane and N for the nucleocapsid. This nucleocapsid contains a 29,903 base long, positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome [3]. The virus transmits from person to person mainly via close physical contact and by respiratory aerosols which are produced during coughing, sneezing, and even talking [4]. It is well assumed that the virus may also spread via fecal matters and by fomite transmission, which occurs when a person comes into contact with a contaminated surface [5]. Unrestricted domestic and international air travels from COVID hotspots are also considered significant contributors to the global spread of this viral infection [6].\n\nTo date, several postulations are available regarding the mechanism of the pathogenesis of the virus in a human host. However, the actual mechanistic pathway is still undefined. In general, aerosol droplets containing the virus particle gains access into the human respiratory system, precisely the alveolar membranes [7]. After its entry into the respiratory system, the spike glycoprotein ectodomain present on the viral capsid binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) transmembrane receptor protein, consequently, the RNA genome enters the alveolar cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis [8]. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP; replicase) is eventually translated from its mRNA strand with the help of its main protease enzyme, and the replicase enzyme catalyzes the rapid replication of the viral genome alongside other structural proteins required for reconstructing new viral particles [8]. In addition to these, interactions between the viral antigens and host immune cells are considered as a crucial determinant factor of the immunopathological attributes of COVID-19 [9]. Proinflammatory responses induced from host–virus interactions trigger vasodilation, accumulation of humoral factors that ultimately result in fever, abnormal alveolar exchange and breathing difficulty, leading to death of patients [10].\n\nWhile the pandemic is spreading faster than wildfires, the unavailability of ratified drugs and or vaccine against the same has made the situation more alarming. In this context, recent studies on the use of hydroxychloroquine (an antimalarial drug) in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin [11] and antiretroviral drugs like remdesivir, EIDD-2801 or favipiravir have shown effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Based on this, ivermectin has been recently reported as the most active agent against COVID-19 among the US FDA-approved drugs in vitro trial [13]. Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone natively used to treat a broad spectrum of parasitic infestations including lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis [14]. Interestingly, a recent study claims that the drug inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in in vitro condition and can reduce the spread of the virus by approximately 5000-times within 48 h while being tested in vitro using primate cell lines [13]. Considering the therapeutic promise of ivermectin against COVID-19 [15], the present study has been conducted to represent the efficacy of this drug against the four most crucial functional proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced biocomputational approaches. Moreover, the efficacy of ivermectin has been compared with two of the recently used anticorona drugs, namely hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir.\n\nMaterials & methods Data mining The commercial ivermectin formulation is comprised of a racemic mixture of -O-dimethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a (ivermectin B1a) and 5-O-dimethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b (ivermectin B1b) and both structures were used in this study. 3D structures of ivermectin homologs, hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir were retrieved from PubChem compound library (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The structures were converted in .pdb format for further use. The structure of each ligand of ivermectin obtained from the Pubchem library was converted to 3D conformer (Supplementary Figure 1A) with minimal energy using Frog2 server. The 3D conformers of both remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine were downloaded from PubChem library. All these 3D conformers were used in protein–ligand docking study. Full-length amino acid sequences of human ACE2 receptor protein (Accession ID: AAT45083.1), Human TMPRSS2 (Accession ID: AAH51839.1), SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD; Accession ID: pdb|6M17|F) and SARS-CoV-2 NSP9 replicase enzyme (Accession ID: pdb|6W4B|A) were retrieved from NCBI protein database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Furthermore, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 protease (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 6Y2E [DOI: 10.2210/pdb6Y2E/pdb]) was obtained from the RCSB PDB (www.rcsb.org). The crystal structure was generated ab initio by using x-ray diffraction techniques with a resolution of 1.75Å. A resolution below 3.0Å suggests good structural detailing which is desirable for molecular docking studies. This structure was introduced to PyMOL software application, whereby water molecules present in the original crystal structure were separated and removed from the native structure of the protein such to avoid undesirable interferences. On the other side, the structure of S2 subunit of spike protein was separately modeled by using the amino acid sequence of S2 and PDB ID 6VYB as a template. Crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 in native form, the RDRP was acquired from PDB (ID: 6M71). 3D structure of target proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and humans are represented in Supplementary Figure 1B–H. Homology modeling & model validation 3D structures of the target proteins/peptides were built through homology modeling strategy using the MODELLER software (Ver. 9.24 x64 Windows). The stereochemical qualities of the generated models were assessed by determining Ramachandran Plots using the structural assessment tool provided by the SWISS-MODEL web server (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/). Molecular docking & visualization The solved molecular structures obtained from PDB afterword homology modeling were subjected to protein–ligand docking using Hex 8.0.0 software package. Hex 8.0.0 is a Fourier transform (FFT)-based protein docking program wherein receptor and ligand structures were fed into the program in terms of PDB files for interaction based on the shape and electrostatic correlation parameters. The output of the docking study for each experiment was also subjected to postprocess analysis using optimized potentials for liquid simulations force field minimization for optimizing the global E Tot output. The energy values (E-values) were recorded for each output docked complex. The structures of the docked receptor–ligand complexes were later rendered and visualized using the Visual Molecular Dynamics software suite (Ver. 1.9.3) and further interpreted accordingly. Drug–target interactions Protein–drug interactions were determined by analyzing the docked complexes using Protein Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) server (https://projects.biotec.tu-dresden.de/). PLIP is a Python-based open source software that provides a complete analysis and visualization of the noncovalent protein–ligand interactions even on single-atom level that includes seven prime interaction types like hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, π-stacking, π–cation interactions, salt bridges, water bridges and halogen bonds. Molecular dynamic simulation Molecular dynamics of strongly docked complexes among the drugs and target proteins (e.g., ivermectin and SARS-CoV-2 protease or ivermectin and human ACE2 [hACE2] receptor) were performed through iMODS server to explain the usual protein motion within the internal coordinates through normal mode analysis (NMA) [16]. iMODS is a user-friendly, highly customizable server and discloses several coarse-grained (CG) levels. The server calculates the dihedral coordinates of Cα atoms of large macromolecules. Moreover, the iMODS calculates B-factor, structural deformability and calculates the eigenvalue. Determination of binding free energy The highest active molecule of ivermectin B1b was examined for its binding efficacy against the most favorable target – the RDRP. Binding free energy was calculated using AutoDock software using the following formula: Conversion formula = K d = e { Δ G × 1000 R T } In silico analysis of pharmacokinetics Comparative pharmacokinetic attributes like absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and cytotoxicity as well as other important pharmacological properties (physicochemical properties, lipophilicity, water-solubility and drug-likeness) of the three drugs of choice were analyzed employing SwissADME open-access server (www.swissadme.ch/).\n\nDiscussion Ivermectin is a popular choice of drug for treating various parasitic infections till today. Since 1987, this drug has been used to treat more than 3.7 billion onchocerciasis patients through the Mectizan Donation Programme sponsored by Merck for eliminating of onchocerciasis [20]. Furthermore, lymphatic filariasis was included in this program in 1998 [21]. Ivermectin is also a member of the three-drug combinatorial therapy alongside the albendazole and diethylcarbamazine [22]. Ivermectin is also efficacious against the Strongyloides, scabies and soil-transmitted helminths [23]. Moreover, ivermectin has also been explored as an endectocide for reducing malarial vectors to reduce the disease transmission [24]. Ivermectin exerts its parasiticidal action through binding and blocking the anion/Cl- ion channels located on the cell membrane, thereby causing disruption of the neuromuscular system leading to paralysis and death [23]. A major advantage of using this FDA-approved drug is its relatively benign nature at treatment doses in humans [25]. Recently, ivermectin has been reported for antiviral activity toward SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [13]. The study depicts that a low dose of ivermectin (5 micromolar) can induce 93% reduction in viral RNA from released virion and 99.8% reduction in cell-associated/unreleased virion after 24 h of incubation [13]. Interestingly, reduction of viral RNA was found to be increased up to 5000-times after 48 h of treatment [13]. Researchers have hypothesized that ivermectin binds and impairs Impα/β1 heterodimer, which plays a key role in binding the cargo protein of coronavirus and facilitates its translocation toward the nucleus [13]. Moreover, researchers have also claimed that ivermectin molecules may act as ionophores and be capable of producing osmotic lysis of the viral membrane [26]. Considering the high and rapid viricidal activity of ivermectin, involvement of a specific target is a question. Therefore, the present study was conducted in silico to explore the possible molecular targets of ivermectin in SARS-CoV-2 and the possible mechanism of interactions between ivermectin and the proteins involved in the viral pathogenesis. Such molecular interactions between ivermectin and the target proteins are most likely mediating the rapid and intense antiviral efficacy of ivermectin. Spike glycoprotein has been the major viral molecule involved in binding host cell surface receptor and establishing infection [1]. Our molecular docking data and counter verification by molecular dynamic simulation collectively evidenced that ivermectin targets S2 subunit of spike protein and may cause conformational change, which may interfere with spike protein-ACE2 interaction (Figure 1A, Table 1 & Supplementary Table 1). SARS-CoV-2 uses a protease enzyme, namely chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or main protease (Mpro), which perform an important function to prime spike protein-mediated binding to human ACE2 and entry of the virus [3]. Herein, we checked the interaction between ivermectin and the viral protease and found a strong hydrophobic interaction between these two (Figure 1B & Table 1). Interestingly, the binding efficacy of ivermectin to SARS-CoV-2 replicase/RDRP was to found to be relatively high (Figure 2A–B & Table 1). In fact, ivermectin was found to be the best out of the three drugs in binding with viral replicase (Supplementary Table 2). Taking clue from the hypothesis on the effect of ivermectin on the viral targets, we further checked whether ivermectin could have any interaction with the relating partners present in the human. Earlier studies on the viral pathogenesis demonstrated the importance of human ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 proteins and for this reason the effect of ivermectin on these two targets were studied. We have documented a relatively weak binding of ivermectin B1A isomer with ACE2 from the biocomputational study (Supplementary Figure 3), orchestrated mainly by the residues of Asn61 and Asn64 on ACE2 (Supplementary Table 1). However, ivermectin B1B isomer was found to exert strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction with ACE2 receptor of human (Supplementary Table 1). These data are encouraging as ACE2 mediates several important physiological functions in the human body including regulation of blood pressure and therefore an effect on this receptor could induce severe physiological imbalance. However, ivermectin was found to bind with TMPRSS2 with a better affinity and stability (Figure 2C). In recent times, hydroxychloroquine has been tested for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 [11] and it has been reported to inhibit the function of spike protein via binding with the sialic acid residue of membrane ganglioside [27]. On the other hand, remdesivir has also come out as another choice of drug for treating severe corona-patients and reported to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 via direct binding with the viral RDRP [28]. But, this in silico study is a maiden report to compare the relative binding potential of these two drugs with ivermectin and presenting ivermectin as a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent for its widespread use in the near future. In an earlier study, it has been clearly described that the inhibitory effect of ivermectin on SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by its direct binding to the active site residues of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp such as Ser759, Asp760 and -Asp761 that are present in the active site of the enzyme [29]. Interestingly, our data indicated that ivermectin strongly and stably binds with the viral replicase compared with hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir, while stability of ivermectin-viral protein complexes including S1 RBD, S2 protein, RDRP, TMPRSS2 was found to be better than that of remdesivir. The efficacy of ivermectin B1b has been found to be more than that of its B1a isomer. In recent times, studies on the comparative proteomics of ivermectin-treated SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-treated cell lines also supported the multitargeted action of ivermectin [30,31]. Eweas et al. [30] suggested a strong affinity of ivermectin toward N phosphoprotein and nsp14, which has been postulated to be involved in inhibiting the viral replication and assembly). A study conducted by Lehrer et al. [31] also provided evidence on the strong interaction of ivermectin with spike protein existing in a bound form with ACE2. A recent quantitative proteomics study by Li et al. [32] revealed alterations in the expression of 52 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-related proteins in ovarian cancer cell line after ivermectin treatment and such alterations in the proteins induced by ivermectin were found to influence the signaling event majorly involving cytokines and growth factor family, MAP kinase and G-protein family, and HLA class proteins. All these evidences support the findings of the present study indicating ivermectin as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. Moreover, our in silico analyses on the pharmacokinetic profiles of these three drugs of interest also revealed ivermectin as a suitable drug candidate. As compared with hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir, ivermectin has relatively much higher water solubility and lipophilicity, further, having lesser skin permeation on the other hand (Supplementary Table 2). The three drugs included in the study are FDA-approved drugs and used for treating various parasitic (ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine) and viral (remdesivir) infections of human. However, to present the suitability of ivermectin for treating COVID-19, we have compared the pharmacological properties of ivermectin with the other two drugs. Taken together, our data on the interaction between ivermectin and viral proteins indicated that ivermectin majorly acts by interfering with the viral entry through inhibiting the function of spike protein and protease. These studies also indicate that ivermectin may also target human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for exerting its inhibitory action over SARS-CoV-2. However, all these in silico studies require subsequent experimental validation, which could enable Ivermectin as a drug of reliance to be used for counteracting the viral growth.\n\nConclusion Developing an effective therapeutic against COVID-19 is currently the utmost interest to the scientific communities. The present study depicts comparative binding efficacy of a promising FDA-approved drug, ivermectin, against major pathogenic proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and their human counterparts involved in host–pathogen interaction. Herein, our in silico data have indicated that ivermectin efficiently utilizes viral spike protein, main protease, replicase and human TMPRSS2 receptors as the most possible targets for executing its antiviral efficiency. Therefore, ivermectin exploits protein targets from both virus and human, which could be the reason behind its excellent in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 as reported by Caly et al. [13]. Ivermectin B1b isomers have been found to be the more efficacious molecule out of the two homologs. Intriguingly, comparison of the in silico efficiency of ivermectin with currently used anticorona drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir, indicated toward the potential of ivermectin to target the major pathogenic proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Ivermectin is a popular antiparasitic drug and is also safe in children, younger adults, pregnant and lactating ladies. Development of pulmonary delivery of ivermectin through synthesis of better ivermectin formulation has been reported recently and this is expected to shorten the treatment duration and lead to better outcomes [33]. It is noteworthy to mention that many anti-SARS-CoV-2s are now being tested for their efficacy in shaping the immune response of humans, through targeting the cell surface as well as intracellular toll-like receptors [34,35]. In this context, ivermectin could be an effective option as well. Considering all these facts, the present study explores the therapeutic targets of ivermectin against SARS-CoV-2 and enlightens the possibility of using this drug in COVID-19 clinical trials shortly. Summary points. The present in silico study presents the therapeutic efficacy of ivermectin against SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to two recently used anti SARS-CoV-2 drugs, namely remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine.\n\nMolecular docking was performed using the drugs of interest and various proteins involved in the infection cycle of SARS-CoV-2 such as spike glycoprotein, main protease, replicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, human ACE2 receptor and human transmembrane serine protease. The dynamics of the interaction was further analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation studies and the binding free energy of binding of ivermectin to each protein was determined.\n\nThe pharmacokinetic attributes of ivermectin were compared with other two anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and ivermectin was found to be a safe drug.\n\nIvermectin was found to be an efficient inhibitor of Mpro, replicase and hTMPRSS2 and the study manifests a superior ground for the candidature of ivermectin to be an efficient anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic option.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplementary data To view the supplementary data that accompany this paper please visit the journal website at: www.futuremedicine.com/doi/suppl/10.2217/fvl-2020-0342\n\nAuthor contributions A Choudhury, NC Das and R Patra performed all the experiments; A Choudhury, M Bhattacharya and S Mukherjee analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript: NC Das, R Patra, P Ghosh and BC Patra edited the draft; S Mukherjee finalized the manuscript, designed and supervised the study.\n\nAcknowledgments The authors acknowledge the efforts of all the doctors, health workers, scientists and researchers presently involved in the treatment and research on COVID-19.

    "title": "Helping patients with ethical concerns about COVID-19 vaccines in light of fetal cell lines used in some COVID-19 vaccines",
    "text": "Abstract Many persons with religious convictions report hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines, in part due to ethical concerns that fetal cell lines are used in the development of certain vaccines. The issue of abortion is contentious and, given the potential impact on COVID-19 vaccination, it is important for clinicians to be aware of this issue, whatever their personal beliefs. I provide four responses that clinicians may offer their patients: 1) Ethical analyses of moral complicity and COVID vaccines. 2) Altruism and protecting others from a virus that is often transmitted while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. 3) Religious texts and many religious leaders support prevention and, therefore, vaccination. 4) Administration of vaccines not developed in fetal cell lines. Although I wish for all my patients to be vaccinated, I respect their autonomy to make the choice to be or not to be vaccinated and understand that many have a deep regard for fetal life. Keywords: COVID-19 vaccines, Vaccine ethics, Fetal cell line ethics\n\n1. Background Many persons with religious convictions report hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines. A Pew Research Survey conducted in February 2021 found that 36% of Protestants and 22% of Catholics are unwilling to be vaccinated; subgroup analyses found that 45% of white evangelicals and 33% of black Protestants are unwilling [1]. Although many reasons underlie this hesitancy, one area of reported concerns is that receiving such vaccines implicates the recipient with cooperation with abortion. The issue of abortion is contentious and, given the potential impact on COVID-19 vaccination, it is important for clinicians to be aware of this issue, whatever their personal beliefs. In an article published in Vaccine in 2004, I reported on an analysis of ethical concerns raised on web sites about vaccines grown in human tissue cultures that were originally derived from abortions [2]. The web sites raised a variety of concerns including lack of respect for fetal body parts, implication of material cooperation in abortion, vaccination implies agreement with abortion, profiteering from abortion, and autonomy. Cell lines developed from past abortions are used in the testing or development of certain COVID-19 vaccines. The HEK 293 cell line was developed in Holland in the early 1970s from embryonal kidney tissue from a supposedly therapeutic abortion that was transformed by adenovirus type 5. The PER.C6 cell line was developed in 1995 from retinal tissue from an abortion in 1985 that was transformed by adenovirus type 5. The University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine ChAdOX1 nCoV-19 is developed in the HEK 293 cell line and the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine Adenovirus 26 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S is developed in the PER.C6 cell line; however, the final products do not contain fetal cells. The mRNA vaccines are not manufactured in cell lines, although testing of mRNA vaccines reportedly uses cell lines.\n\n2. Response #1: Ethical analyses of moral complicity and COVID vaccines Bioethicist Robert Orr MD suggested criteria for evaluating moral complicity: (1) timing, (2) proximity, (3) certitude, (4) knowledge and (5) intent [3]. (1) Facilitating a future immoral act is clearly problematic whereas indirect association with a completed, past action may be unavoidable. For example, driving on a road that was originally built with slave labor may be difficult to avoid in some places. The abortions resulting in these cell lines occurred in the 1970s and 1980s are separate in time, intent and deed from vaccination today. (2) Proximity deals with the closeness of persons with the action. For instance, a school is not responsible for teaching chemistry that a graduate used in planning a bombing; it is the graduate who is responsible for such an evil action. Although the original cell that resulted in the cell line was derived from an abortion, the current cell lines have multiplied many times – it is not the original tissue. Indeed, vaccination today is remote in intent and deed from cell strain establishment and from abortion that occurred more than a quarter century ago. (3) Certitude deals with how well the facts are known. First, the facts related to cell lines are fairly well established. Second, for public health, the CDC ACIP Evidence to Recommendation Framework specifically addresses certainty of the evidence for critical outcomes [4] and has found high certainty for prevention of symptomatic COVID-19. (4) Knowledge of the moral issue is the next criterion. Many car drivers in the southern part of the US do not know if some of the roads that they use were originally made with slave labor over a hundred and fifty years ago. In an analogous manner, a person who is vaccinated today would not be accountable for detailed knowledge of circumstances of a quarter or half century ago, before many of the vaccinees were even born. (5) Intent is the final criterion. The intent of the development of COVID-19 vaccines is to protect the vaccinee, protect the population and control the pandemic. For those with a prolife viewpoint, Dr. Orr notes: “It might be possible to remove any concern about moral complicity in those situations where there is a clear separation between the intention of the immoral act of person A and the intention of person B. For example, in the vaccine example, the intention of person A was to end a pregnancy, not to develop a vaccine. Development of the vaccine by person C was a noble act that happened to be possible because of the earlier immoral act of person A. Thus, use of the vaccine by person B is clearly separated from the immoral act, so that person B should bear no moral culpability” [3]. The Principle of Double Effect is used to evaluate moral conflicts when an action could produce both good and bad effects. These criteria include: (1) the action itself must be morally indifferent or good, (2) the bad effect must not be the means by which the good effect is achieved, (3) the motive must be the achievement of the good effect only, and (4) the good effect must be at least equivalent in importance to the bad effect [5]. To apply these criteria to COVID 19 vaccination: (1) the act of vaccination is good as it prevents disease in the recipient and contributes to herd immunity. (2) The aforementioned abortions were independent events performed decades ago for purposes other than vaccination; the disease was not known to exist then. (3) The motive for vaccination is protection of the vaccinee and, secondarily, protection of their contacts and the community by herd immunity; thus, the motives are good. (4) The good effect, saving of hundreds of thousands of lives in this circumstance, is clearly greater than the bad effect. For reference, as of this publication, greater than 5989,000 persons have died due to COVID-19 in the US.\n\n3. Response #2: Altruism and protecting others from a virus that is often transmitted while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic Vaccination is a priority because it reduces viral transmission [6], thereby protecting others. COVID-19 is highly transmissible person-to-person, including asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic persons [7]. Indeed, 44% of secondary cases are infected during the pre-symptomatic stage [8], before a primary case would know to isolate to protect others. Furthermore, at least a third of cases are from asymptomatic spread, in which case no extra isolation measures could be planned [7]. Thus, given that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission reduces the potential for symptomatic-based prevention measures such as isolation, another strategy is needed out of concern for others. Vaccination reduces not only symptomatic infection, but asymptomatic infection and transmission as well. Herd immunity can protect vulnerable persons, such as those with immunocompromising conditions or the very aged, who may not respond as well to vaccination or persons with allergic conditions that preclude vaccination. To achieve herd immunity, contacts of the vulnerable, in particular, and the general population at large need to be vaccinated. Israel, among the first countries to see high vaccination rates against COVID-19, has seen a drop in cases that can be attributed to herd immunity [9]. Vaccination with the purpose to achieve herd immunity and protect others is altruistic.\n\n4. Response #3: Religious texts and many religious leaders support prevention and vaccination Religious texts support prevention and altruism. In the context of the ancient Middle East, during which time people spent time on their roof, it is written “When you build a new house, be sure to put a railing around the edge of the roof. Then you will not be responsible if someone falls off and is killed” (Deuteronomy 22:8, Good News Translation (GNT)). Physical protection, even with human-made instruments, is seen as a blessing: “May his towns be protected with iron gates” (Deuteronomy 33:25, GNT). The “Love one another” passages in the New Testament support caring for another, with direct attention to caring for physical needs: “…our love should not be just words … shows itself in action.” (1 John 3:18 GNT). Being vaccinated dramatically reduces the risk that one will transmit virus to others. A number of religious leaders from a variety of faiths have spoken in favor of vaccination – see Table 1 . Table 1. Sampling of quotes or notes by religious leaders promoting COVID-19 vaccination. Judaism Three of the most senior rabbis in ultra-Orthodox Judaism -- Chaim Kanievsky, Gershon Edelstein, and Shalom Cohen -- recommended recently that “anyone who has the option of getting the vaccine should get it.” https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210126/faith-leaders-spread-the-word-get-vaccinated Protestant Christianity “And I think when trusted religious voices can help people accept that the vaccine is a good and godly thing to do, that helps reach people who might not trust it from other voices in the community.’ Bishop Scott Jones, United Methodist Church. https://www.christiansandthevaccine.com/episodes/jones Catholic Christianity “It is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process. Due to the situation of the ongoing pandemic, “all vaccinations recognized as clinically safe and effective can be used in good conscience with the certain knowledge that the use of such vaccines does not constitute formal cooperation with the abortion from which the cells used in production of the vaccines derive.”\n\nThe Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2020–12/vatican-cdf-note-covid-vaccine-morality-abortion.html Islam So on March 18, Hassan and 15 other imams from around Minnesota gathered at a local health care clinic in Minneapolis. Not only did they get vaccinated against a virus that wracked their community; they did so on camera, in front of multiple Somali-language media outlets to make their message loud and clear. Imam Hassan Ali Mohamud thought of a passage from the Qur’an. Saving one person’s life is equal to saving all of humanity, according to the often cited passage. Which means it’s fairly easy to argue that receiving the vaccine is a religious duty, Hassan said. https://sahanjournal.com/coronavirus/minnesota-imams-vaccination-event/ Evangelical Christianity “Indeed, the vaccines are a cause for Christians to rejoice and to give glory to God. The Bible, after all, speaks of medicine as a common grace, discovered by human beings but given by God…By getting vaccinated as soon as our time is called, we can actively work for what we have been praying for — churches filled with people, hugs in the church foyer, and singing loudly together the hymns we love.” Russell Moore and Walter Kim (National Association of Evangelicals) https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2021/02/24/evangelicals-covid-vaccine-russell-moore-walter-kim/ Hindu In January, Swayamprakash Swami,… a senior monk affiliated with BAPS, a mainstream Hindu denomination, gave his blessing to the Covid-19 shots. The ancient Hindu principle of ahimsa, an exhortation to do no harm and revere life, is being used to encourage Hindus in North America to embrace the vaccine, said Dr. Kashyap Patel, a cardiologist in Atlanta who is a medical adviser to BAPS. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/14/health/clergy-covid-vaccine.html Orthodox Christianity Father Paul Abernathy, pastor of St. Moses the Black Orthodox Church, worked on training of community liaisons to serve as “living, breathing, walking ambassadors of the vaccine.” https://www.publicsource.org/pittsburgh-black-churches-improve-access-to-covid-19-vaccine/ Mormonism “The church urges its members, employees and missionaries to be good global citizens and help quell the pandemic by safeguarding themselves and others through immunization” https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/utah/articles/2021–01-19/mormon-leaders-urge-members-to-get-covid-19-vaccine Open in a new tab\n\n5. Response #4: Administration of vaccines not developed in fetal cell lines For those patients who refuse a vaccine that is developed in a cell line that was derived from an abortion, alternatives exist: for instance, mRNA vaccines as a class are not designed, developed or produced in fetal cell lines [10]. In addition to the mRNA vaccines, other classes are in development with products not designed or produced in fetal cell lines. As a note to manufacturers, vaccine designers and policy officials, development of vaccines in cell lines that are not derived from abortion is feasible, eliminates this controversy, may increase vaccination rates and may result in higher sales. For these reasons, I recommend use of uncontroversial cell lines. In conclusion, I have provided four different responses that a clinician can use with those patients who have ethical concerns about certain COVID-19 vaccines that were developed in fetal cell lines. Although I wish for all my patients to be vaccinated, I respect their autonomy to make the choice to be or not to be vaccinated and understand that many have a deep regard for fetal life.\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Dr. Zimmerman has a pending grant with Sanofi Pasteur on an unrelated topic.",

    "title": "C/EBP homologous protein deficiency enhances hematopoietic stem cell function via reducing ATF3/ROS‐induced cell apoptosis",
    "text": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in a quiescent niche to reserve their capacity of self‐renewal. Upon hematopoietic injuries, HSCs enter the cell cycle and encounter protein homeostasis problems caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins. However, the mechanism by which protein homeostasis influences HSC function and maintenance remains poorly understood. Here, we show that C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), demonstrated previously to induces cell death upon unfolded protein response (UPR), plays an important role in HSCs regeneration. CHOP −/− mice showed normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell frequencies in steady state. However, when treated with 5‐FU, CHOP deficiency resulted in higher survival rates, associated with an increased number of HSCs and reduced level of apoptosis. In serial competitive transplantation experiments, CHOP −/− HSCs showed a dramatic enhancement of repopulation ability and a reduction of protein aggresomes. Mechanistically, CHOP deletion causes reduced ATF3 expression and further leads to decreased protein aggregation and ROS. In addition, CHOP −/− HSCs exhibited an increased resistance to IR‐induced DNA damage and improved HSCs homeostasis and function in telomere dysfunctional (G3Terc −/− ) mice. In summary, these findings disclose a new role of CHOP in the regulation of the HSCs function and homeostasis through reducing ATF3 and ROS signaling.\n\nTo this end, we used CHOP‐deficient (CHOP −/− ) mice to explore the functional impact of CHOP on HSCs during homeostasis maintenance, stress response, and aging. In young mice, CHOP −/− HSCs exhibited an increased self‐renewal and differentiation during competitive serial transplantation. C/EBP homologous protein deficiency caused HSCs to recover faster after 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) administration due to less apoptosis. For the mechanism, CHOP deletion causes reduced ATF3 expression and decreased protein aggregation, which further reduces ROS and cell apoptosis. In addition, CHOP deletion promoted HSC survival after ionizing radiation (IR) and improved the HSC self‐renewal capacity in mice with short telomeres. Taken together, these data revealed an essential role of CHOP in HSC function and regeneration via ATF3/ROS pathway.\n\nSeveral proteostatic mechanisms in HSCs ensure the integrity of the proteome by promoting efficient folding of unfolded and misfolded proteins, most notably the UPR (UPR ER ). Prevention of UPR ER ‐induced apoptosis by the RNA binding protein Dppa5, chemical chaperones, and hypoxia‐inducible factor 2a (HIF2a) limit ER stress and promote HSC function (Miharada et al., 2014 ; Rouault‐Pierre et al., 2013 ). In particular, HIF2a limits ROS production in quiescent HSCs, thereby preventing ROS‐induced ER stress, but is dispensable for HSC maintenance (Rouault‐Pierre et al., 2013 ). Another chemical chaperones, bile acids mitigate ER stress to ensure that rapidly expanding fetal liver HSCs adequately adapt to higher rates of protein synthesis (Sigurdsson et al., 2016 ). In addition, human HSCs are predisposed to apoptosis by strong activation of the PERK branch of UPR after ER stress, whereas closely related progenitors exhibit an adaptive response leading to their survival (van Galen et al., 2014 ). In this case, deletion of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a key transcription factor downstream of PERK, prevents cell death upon tunicamycin‐induced unfolded protein response (UPR). However, it is still unknown whether CHOP plays an important role in HSCs regeneration, especially during serial transplantation, DNA damage responses, or the process of aging.\n\nHematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are subset of cells, reside in bone marrow (BM) niches and have a unique capacity to serve as the origin of life‐long multi‐lineage hematopoiesis (Laurenti & Gottgens, 2018 ; Morrison & Spradling, 2008 ; Orkin & Zon, 2008 ; Scadden, 2006 ). In the adult BM, HSCs are predominantly maintained in a quiescence state, protecting them from accumulating damages (e.g., DNA damages) and allowing them to support blood production for an entire lifespan (Morrison & Spradling, 2008 ). In response to hematological stress, such as 5‐FU administration, BM transplantation, and IR radiation, these cells can be readily activated, enter the cell cycle, and robustly repopulate the entire hematopoietic system via multi‐lineage differentiation and self‐renewal, which is accompanied with a high protein synthesis rate (Chandel et al., 2016 ; Heijmans et al., 2013 ; Kohli & Passegue, 2014 ; Laurenti & Gottgens, 2018 ). Higher protein synthesis upon enhanced cell proliferation and abundant protein production/secretion leads to accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins, which is a major cause for ER stress (Luo & Lee, 2013 ).\n\nFurthermore, the overexpression of ATF3 in CHOP −/− LSK cells showed decreased percentage of GFP‐positive donor‐derived cells in PB and BM (Figure 5j,k and Figure S6 g). The apoptosis analysis also showed that overexpression of ATF3 has increased Annexin V + cells compared with SFLV‐ctrl cells (Figure 5l,m ).\n\nAfter 9 days of 5‐FU administration, ROS level increased in hematopoietic stem‐ and progenitor cells. C/EBP homologous protein deficiency rescues the increased ROS level due to 5‐FU significantly (Figure 5h,i ). The LT‐HSCs with high level of ROS showed high expression of CHOP (Figure S6 h), indicating CHOP plays an important role of it. 5‐FU administration significantly reduced expression of several anti‐oxidative stress response genes, including Sod3, Mt2, and Dusp1, in a CHOP‐dependent way, which may also contribute to increased oxidative stress and reduced survival rate of wild‐type mice (Figure S6 d).\n\nFurthermore, we checked the level of aggregated proteins via the protein aggregation kit after 9 days of 5‐FU administration (Sigurdsson et al., 2016 ). The level of aggregated proteins was significantly increased within the HSC population of CHOP +/+ mice, while the CHOP −/− mice contained only half the level of aggregated proteins in comparison with CHOP +/+ mice (Figure 5d,e ). Similarly, after transplantation CHOP −/− mice had less aggregated proteins than CHOP +/+ mice (Figure 5f,g ).\n\nCHOP deletion decreases apoptosis via ATF3/Protein aggregation/ROS axis. (a) The mRNA expression of ATF3 in LSK from CHOP +/+ and CHOP −/− mice was measured via real‐time PCR. The relative expression was normalized to β‐actin for statistical analysis (n = 3–4 per group).

(j) ATF3‐cDNA or empty vector infected LSK cells were transplanted along with noninfected cells into lethally irradiated recipients. The infection efficiency was 30% and was normalized to 1.

(k) The histogram depicts changes in bone marrow chimerisms of infected cells (GFP‐positive) in primary recipients at the indicated time points after transplantation (n = 3 per group). (l, m) The apoptosis was detected with Annexin V/DAPI staining in LSK and LT‐HSCs GFP + cells after transplantation 10 days. The early apoptosis (Annexin V + /DAPI − ) and late apoptotic cells (Annexin V + /DAPI + ) are shown (n = 4 per group). (n) Mechanism for CHOP‐mediated cell apoptosis. In response to replication stress, CHOP was activated, which further induces ATF3 expression. ATF3 contributes to increased GADD34 expression and over‐enhanced protein synthesis. In the end, this process produces ROS as a signal to promote cell apoptosis. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; NS, not significant\n\nFor the underlying mechanism of CHOP in HSCs under stress condition, we applied chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP‐seq) to find out the direct target genes of CHOP in mouse Lin‐ cells. ChIP‐seq analysis identified several CHOP target genes, including ATF3, which was also verified by ChIP‐Q‐PCR (Figure S6 e,f). The Q‐PCR results showed specifically that the expression of ATF3 decreased in CHOP −/− LSK cells in compare with CHOP +/+ LSK cells, which was also shown in RNA‐seq data (Figure 5a,b and Figure S6 c). Increased ATF3 may promote Gadd34 expression, which directs the type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) to dephosphorylate eIF2 (Jiang et al., 2004 ) and leads to protein synthesis. Han et al. found that overexpression of CHOP induces apoptosis in MEFs through transcriptionally increasing the protein synthesis‐related genes and ROS (Han et al., 2013 ). However, the molecular mechanism of CHOP‐induced apoptosis in HSCs seems unclear; therefore, we hypothesize that CHOP may regulate HSC apoptosis through ATF3‐induced protein synthesis and ROS. The protein synthesis rate was checked in HSCs of CHOP +/+ and CHOP −/− mice after 5‐FU administration. OP‐Puro assay, an effective method to measure the protein synthesis in the cell, in which the treated mice cells show increased fluorescence level then untreated mice (Signer et al., 2014 ). After 9 days of 5‐FU administration, OP‐Puro was injected into mice and the mice were sacrificed 1 h later. The result showed that CHOP −/− mice had less protein synthesis than CHOP +/+ mice in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (Figure 5c ).\n\nC/EBP homologous protein has been reported to induce apoptosis by regulating apoptosis gene expression during ER stress (Kim et al., 2006 ; Malhotra et al., 2008 ). However, in HSCs, there was no difference in mRNA level of apoptosis‐related genes between CHOP −/− and CHOP +/+ LSK cells at day 3 and 9 after 5‐FU administration (Figure S6 a,b).\n\nTo evaluate the influence of CHOP deficiency on HSC function of G3Terc −/− mice, we performed a competitive transplantation assay (Figure 4e ). 300 LT‐HSCs from G3CHOP −/− or G3CHOP +/+ mice (CD45.2) were mixed with 3 × 10 5 competitor BM cells (CD45.1) and injected into lethally irradiated recipient mice (CD45.1/2). The chimerism in PB was examined monthly after transplantation (Figure 4f ). G3CHOP −/− LT cells showed a higher contribution in the first recipients than G3CHOP +/+ LT cells (Figure 4f ). After 12 weeks, we analyzed the BM of G3CHOP +/+ and G3CHOP −/− . G3CHOP −/− BM chimerism was fourfold increased compared with G3CHOP +/+ BM chimerism (Figure 4g ). Furthermore, in the BM, CHOP deficiency decreased the ratio of myeloid cells and increased the ratio of T cells and B cells after transplantation (Figure S5 c,d). The chimerism in B lymphocytes and myeloid cells also showed a clear increase (Figure S5 e,f).\n\nCHOP deficiency improves HSC homeostasis and function in telomere dysfunctional mice. (a) Representative FACS plots of T (CD4/8 + ) cells, B (B220 + ) cells and M (CD11b + ) cells in the bone marrow in Terc +/+ , Terc −/− , and Terc −/− CHOP −/− mice. (b) Percentage of wild‐type T cells, B cells, and M cells in the bone marrow compared with Terc −/− mice. CHOP deletion improves B cells development and decreases myeloid proliferation (n = 3–4 per group).

(e) Experimental schematic for competitive transplantation with CHOP +/+ or Terc −/− CHOP +/+ or Terc‐/‐ CHOP −/− LT cells (results in f and g). (f) The transplantation was conducted using 300 purified LT (CD34 − , Flt‐3 − LSK) cells along with 3 × 10 5 fresh competitors. Percentage of donor‐derived PB cells at the indicated time points in competitive transplantation assay are shown (n = 3–5 per group). (g) Percentage of donor‐derived LSK (Lin − , Sca‐1 + ,c‐kit + ) cells, LT (CD34 − , Flt‐3 − LSK) cells and ST (CD34 + , Flt‐3 − LSK) cells 12 weeks after transplantation are shown (n = 3–4 per group). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; NS, not significant\n\nHere, we crossed Terc +/− and CHOP +/− mice and got the late‐generation of telomerase knockout mice G3CHOP −/− (G3Terc −/− CHOP −/− ) with CHOP deficiency. C/EBP homologous protein deficiency rescued the reduction of B lymphocyte and T lymphocyte ratio in the BM, as well as the reduced B lymphocyte numbers in the spleen of 7‐ to 8‐month‐old G3Terc −/− mice (Figure 4a,b and Figure S5 a). In the hematopoietic system, the number of CLP cells (referred to as Sca1 low c‐kit low CD127 high and Flt3 high cells) decreased in G3Terc −/− mice (Figure 4c,d ), which could explain the reduction of B lymphocyte and T lymphocyte numbers in the BM; those were also rescued by CHOP deficiency. While the LSK cells and LT‐HSCs (referred to as CD34 − , Flt3 − LSK cells) did not show obvious differences between G3CHOP +/+ and G3CHOP −/− mice (Figure S5 b).\n\nTelomere dysfunction is another DNA damage‐induced aging stress in HSCs. In line with previous studies, aged mice with dysfunctional telomeres showed that the latter can impair the function and engraftment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, limit B lymphocyte development and increase myeloid proliferation, which are hallmarks of an aging hematopoietic system (Ju et al., 2007 ). However, whether CHOP plays a role in HSCs of telomere dysfunctional mice is unclear.\n\nTo understand the underlying mechanisms, we examined the apoptosis rate by Annexin V/DAPI staining in HSCs 16 h after 2‐Gy IR treatment. Interestingly, at that time point, the induction of apoptosis in CHOP −/− HSCs was less than half of CHOP +/+ HSCs (Figure 3h,i ). These results indicate that CHOP deficiency also suppresses IR‐induced apoptosis in HSCs.\n\nTo test the effect of CHOP deficiency on the DNA damage response in HSCs, we also conducted a single‐cell colony‐forming assay using HSCs treated with 2‐Gy IR. The suppression of single‐cell colony‐forming ability by IR was significantly less in CHOP −/− HSCs than in CHOP +/+ HSCs (Figure 3g ), indicating that CHOP deficiency results in a significant IR resistance in HSCs.\n\nNext, we performed competitive experiment for LSK by IR in vitro (Figure 3d ). Six thousand LSK cells from young CHOP −/− or CHOP +/+ mice (CD45.2) were mixed with 1.5 × 10 6 competitor BM cells (CD45.1), after suffering a 2‐Gy IR, then were injected into lethally irradiated recipient mice (CD45.1/2). Unlike the competitive experiment for LSK without IR, the chimerism in PB showed no difference in the first month, however, on the 3rd and 4th month, the chimerism in PB showed significant difference between CHOP −/− and CHOP +/+ derived cells (Figure 1b and Figure 3e ). After 4 months, CHOP −/− BM chimerism analysis showed a 1.5‐fold increase compared with CHOP +/+ BM chimerism (Figure 3f ).\n\nCHOP deficiency ameliorates IR‐induced functional decline in HSCs.

(b) 1 × 10 6 donor BM cells mixed with 1 × 10 6 competitor BM cells. After 3 months, recipient mice suffered 4.5‐Gy IR.

(d) Experimental schematic for competitive transplantation with CHOP −/− and CHOP +/+ LSK, mixed with competitor. Recipients were irradiated with 2‐Gy. (e) 6000 donor LSK cells mixed with 1.5 × 10 6 competitor BM cells. After in vitro irradiation with 2‐Gy, mixed cells were injected into recipient mice immediately. Percentage of donor‐derived PB cells at the indicated time point in LSK transplantation after 2‐Gy IR is shown (n = 3–4 per group). (f) Percentage of donor‐derived LSK (Lin − , Sca‐1 + , c‐kit + ) cells and LT (CD34 − , Flt‐3 − LSK) cells 16 weeks after LSK transplantation after 2 Gy IR is shown (n = 3 per group). (g) Single LT (CD34 − , Flt‐3 − LSK) cells were sorted in 96‐well plates, followed by 0 or 2‐Gy IR, and cultured for 14 days. Colonies were counted in each group (n = 3 per group). (h, i) LSK cells were sorted in 48‐well plate and treated with 2‐Gy IR. IR‐induced apoptosis was detected with Annexin V/DAPI staining 16 h after 2‐Gy IR. The representative FACS plots were shown on the left (h), and the percentage of Annexin V positive cells is shown on the right (i) (n = 3–4 per group). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; NS, not significant\n\nPrevious studies have shown that CHOP is involved in DNA damage response in MEF cells (Engel et al., 2013 ). To test whether the effect exists in HSCs in vivo, we performed a BM competitive transplantation experiment (Figure 3a ). 1 × 10 6 BM cells from young CHOP −/− or CHOP +/+ mice (CD45.2) were mixed with 1 × 10 6 competitor BM cells (CD45.1) and injected into lethally irradiated recipient mice (CD45.1/2). The chimerism in PB was examined monthly after transplantation (Figure 3b ). Three months after transplantation, we subjected recipient mice (reconstituted with either CHOP −/− or CHOP +/+ BM cells) to 4.5‐Gy IR. After 4.5‐Gy IR, CHOP deficiency gave rise to enhanced protection to IR, reflected in an increased chimerism in PB (Figure 3b ) and BM (Figure 3c ). Staining of gamma‐H2AX in CHOP −/− LSK cells and LT‐HSCs (Flt3 − , CD34 − ) showed decreased levels compared with CHOP +/+ , suggesting that CHOP deficiency protects HSPCs from DNA damage (Figure S4 ).\n\nIn order to find out the underlying mechanisms, we performed a PY/Hoechst assay to examine the cell cycle status of HSCs at day 5, 9, and 12 after 5‐FU administration. There was no significant difference in proliferation in HSCs between CHOP −/− and CHOP +/+ mice (Figure S3 f–h), while the apoptosis assay showed a remarkable decrease of Annexin V + in CHOP −/− LSK cells compared with CHOP +/+ ones after 5‐FU administration 9 days (Figure 2f,g ). The ratio of Annexin V + cells in LT cells also decreased significantly in CHOP −/− mice (Figure 2f,g ). After 5‐FU administration 5 days, the CHOP −/− LSK cells have reduced Annexin V + cells than CHOP +/+ (Figure S3 d). While, after 5‐FU administration 12 days, the differences in apoptosis became smaller (Figure S3 e).\n\nAfter 5‐FU administration, HSCs cells rapidly multiplicated (Figure 2b and Figure S3 a), this process may cause an ER stress problem. To examine whether CHOP is involved in this process, we measured the protein level of CHOP at day 9 after 5‐FU administration by fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of HSCs and progenitors. Compared to control mice treated with PBS, the protein level of CHOP was significantly increased in progenitors and HSCs (Figure S3 b). Real‐time PCR analysis also showed that CHOP mRNA level in LSK cells was higher after 5‐FU administration (Figure S3 c), suggesting a modest role of CHOP in regulating the HSCs regenerative process.\n\nTo evaluate the influence of CHOP deletion on the regenerative capacity of HSCs under hematopoietic stress, we analyzed HSCs at different time points following 5‐FU administration (Figure 2b ). After administration with 5‐FU, LSK (Lineage − , Sca1 + , c‐kit + ) cells were drastically depleted in both the CHOP +/+ and CHOP −/− mice at day 5 and slightly recovered at day 9 (Figure 2b and Figure S3 a). At day 9, the numbers of LT (Flt3‐, CD34‐) cells in CHOP −/− mice were twofold higher than those in CHOP +/+ mice; meanwhile, LSK cell numbers in CHOP −/− mice were also significantly higher compared with CHOP +/+ litter mates (Figure 2b–d ). At day 12, the numbers of both, LSK and LT cells in CHOP −/− mice were significantly higher than those in CHOP +/+ mice (Figure 2b,c ,e). To the end, at day 21, the numbers of LSK cells in CHOP +/+ mice both returned to a low level, whereas a higher number of LSK was still present in the CHOP −/− mice (Figure 2b and Figure S3 a). These data indicate that CHOP deficiency increased the recovery of HSCs after 5‐FU administration.\n\nCHOP deletion increases hematopoietic stem cell number via reducing apoptosis after 5‐FU treatment. (a) Survival curve of CHOP +/+ and CHOP −/− mice following sequential 5‐FU treatment (n = 8 per group). 5‐FU was injected into mice once a week. Representative data from one experiment are shown. (b) Dynamic change of absolute number of LSK cells after 5‐FU treatment detected by flow cytometry (n = 3–4 per group). CHOP +/+ or CHOP −/− mice were analyzed at the indicated time points after 5‐FU treatment. (c) The representative FACS plots of LT (CD34 − Flt‐3 − LSK) cells at day 9 and day 12 after 5‐FU treatment are shown (n = 3–4 per group). The frequency of LT cells in LSK cells between CHOP +/+ and CHOP −/− mice are shown. (d, e) The absolute numbers of LT cells in BM at day 9 and day 12 after 5‐FU treatment are shown (n = 3–4 per group). (f, g) Apoptosis was measured in a donor‐derived population of LSK and LT 9 days after 5‐FU treatment by staining for Annexin V/DAPI. The representative FACS plots are shown on the left (f) and the percentage of Annexin V positive cells is shown on the right (g) (n = 3 per group). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; NS, not significant\n\nTo determine the underlying mechanisms, we performed a PY/Hoechst assay to examine the cell cycle state of HSCs after transplantation. However, there was no significant difference in proliferation in HSCs between CHOP −/− and CHOP +/+ mice (Figure S2 f,g). C/EBP homologous protein is involved in ER stress‐induced apoptosis, which prompted us to examine the ratio of Annexin V + cells in CHOP −/− and CHOP +/+ HSCs. After transplantation 10 days, CHOP −/− LSK cells showed a remarkable decrease of Annexin V + cells compared with CHOP +/+ LSK cells (Figure 1e,f ). While the apoptosis in LT‐HSCs (Flt‐3 − CD34 − LSK cells) has no obvious difference (Figure S2 e). After secondary transplantation, CHOP −/− LSK cells also have significantly reduced Annexin V + cells compared with CHOP +/+ LSK cells (Figure 1e,g ). Taken together, these data indicate that CHOP deficiency enhances HSC self‐renewal and differentiation during serial transplantation by decreasing HSCs apoptosis.\n\nCHOP deficiency improves stem cell function by decreasing apoptosis after transplantation. (a) Experimental schematic for serial competitive transplantation with CHOP +/+ or CHOP −/− LSK cells (results in b–d). (b) Three‐round serial transplantation was conducted using 4000 purified LSK cells along with 1 × 10 6 fresh competitors.

(e) The representative FACS plots of apoptosis after transplantation are shown. The positive control was treated with 0.2 μM TG for 12 h. (f, g) The apoptosis was detected with Annexin V/DAPI staining in LSK cells after first transplantation and second transplantation 10 days. The early apoptosis (Annexin V + /DAPI − ) and late apoptotic cells (Annexin V + /DAPI + ) are shown (n = 3–4 per group). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; NS, not significant\n\nTo evaluate the self‐renewal and differentiation capacity of CHOP −/− and CHOP +/+ HSCs in vivo, we performed a three‐round competitive serial transplantation experiment (Figure 1a ). Four thousand LSK cells from young CHOP −/− or CHOP +/+ mice (CD45.2) were mixed with 1 × 10 6 competitor BM cells (CD45.1) and injected into lethally irradiated recipient mice (CD45.1/2). Three months after transplantation, 4000 donor‐derived LSK cells were isolated, mixed with fresh competitor cells, and re‐transplanted into recipient mice. The chimerism in peripheral blood (PB) was examined monthly after transplantation (Figure 1b ). CHOP −/− LSK cells showed a higher contribution in the first recipients than the CHOP +/+ LSK cells (Figure 1b ). Consistently, CHOP −/− BM chimerism showed a threefold increase compared with CHOP +/+ BM chimerism in the secondary transplantation (Figure 1c ); further, in tertiary recipients, CHOP −/− BM chimerism showed a fivefold increase compared with CHOP +/+ BM chimerism (Figure 1d ). Further analysis of BM in recipient mice revealed that CHOP deficiency resulted in a significant increase of LT‐HSCs after the second and third transplantation, suggesting that CHOP −/− HSCs have enhanced self‐renewal ability (Figure 1c,d ). The chimerism in T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and Myeloid cells also showed a clear increase (Figure S2 b–d). These data indicate that CHOP −/− HSCs had an enhanced ability to reconstitute the PB after the first transplantation, therefore, CHOP deletion enhanced reconstitution capacity of HSCs in serial transplantation.\n\nA recent study demonstrated that CHOP deficiency shows normal homeostasis of HSC and that CHOP expression increased after cord blood transplantation (van Galen et al., 2014 ). In line with this study, we found similar results in the analyses of our CHOP −/− mice (Figure S1 b–f); and interestingly a 2.5‐fold higher mRNA level of CHOP after transplantation (Figure S2 a).\n\n3. DISCUSSION\n\nC/EBP homologous protein has been reported as a transcription factor‐induced downstream of endoplasmic reticulum stress and DNA damage response (Engel et al., 2013; Oyadomari & Mori, 2004; Suzuki et al., 2017), its deletion could inhibit apoptosis according to the context (Doerks et al., 2002; Han et al., 2013). However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate CHOP‐induced apoptosis in HSCs remain a mystery.\n\nThe protein level of CHOP remains low on homeostasis; after tunicamycin (TM) treatment for 4 h, CHOP expression increased visibly in wild‐type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Han et al., 2013). Previous analysis of CHOP‐deficient BM showed a small increase in the quantity of HSPCs. Our study also showed similarly that CHOP deficiency exhibited a normal phenotype regarding homeostasis (van Galen et al., 2014). After hematological stress, 5‐FU treatment and transplantation, HSC numbers increased, accompanied with a high rate of protein synthesis. A high rate of protein synthesis induced by cells proliferation could lead to aggregates of mis/unfold proteins, which further cause an ER stress response. The acute ER stress‐induced apoptosis occurs while cells rapidly proliferating. Although LSK cells and LT‐HSCs have more early apoptosis (Annexin V+ DAPI−), late apoptosis (Annexin V+ DAPI+) is rare. At the same time, the proliferation rate of LSK cells and LT‐HSCs was significantly higher than the proportion of apoptotic cells; therefore, the cell amount keeps increasing.\n\nPrevious study showed that after cord blood transplantation, CHOP and GADD34 expression increased, consistent with a stress response (van Galen et al., 2014). During this process, CHOP is highly expressed and participates in the ER stress‐induced apoptosis (Doerks et al., 2002; Han et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2006; Wielenga et al., 2015). Decreased expression of CHOP rescues the apoptosis and increases the frequency and number of HSCs obviously.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that CHOP induces the expression of apoptosis genes, such as DR5, TRB3, BIM, and PUMA, and represses the expression of BCL2, which triggers apoptosis during ER stress (Kim et al., 2006; Malhotra et al., 2008). In macrophages, CHOP induces the transcription of Ero1α, which then activates calcium‐mediated apoptosis (Signer et al., 2014). Moreover, CHOP interacts and forms heterodimer with ATF4 which initiate the restoration of mRNA translation, leading to increased protein synthesis, ATP depletion, oxidative stress, and cell death in MEFs (Han et al., 2013). However, 5‐FU administration did not lead to decreased expression of apoptosis genes, such as Bid, Bim, and Bcl‐2, whereas displayed a reduced level of aggregated proteins in CHOP−/− mice. Increased accumulation of protein aggregates reduces the ability of quiescent NSCs to be activated during aging (Leeman et al., 2018). Bile acid (BA), as a chemical chaperone, reduces the level of protein aggregates in FL‐HSCs and improves HSCs function after cultured in vitro (Sigurdsson et al., 2016). Increased protein synthesis is accompanied with ROS, which are a necessary signal for apoptosis before restoration of proteostasis (Han et al., 2013). Here, we show that CHOP deficiency reduces the expression of ATF3, which may through inhibiting GADD34 activation, decreases the level of protein aggregates by reducing the rate of protein synthesis in HSCs after 5‐FU treatment and transplantation. Overexpression of ATF3 in CHOP deficiency LSK cells showed decreased chimerism in PB and BM. The ATF3OE LSK cells have induced apoptosis compared with SFLV‐ctrl. Taken together, these results indicate that CHOP deficiency decreases the level of apoptosis by decreasing ATF3 expression, protein aggregation, and oxidative stress.\n\nInterestingly, we found that the percentage of donor‐derived cells in PB shows an obvious increase during the first month, and then remains stable during the next 2 months after first and secondary transplantation, while, during the BM transplantation before 4.5 Gy IR, the chemism in the first 3 months shows no difference (data no shown). The 5‐FU administration assay shows that the number of LSK cells recovered quickly from day 5 to day 9. C/EBP homologous protein‐deficient mice had a 2.5‐fold increased LT cells number, while the number of LSK cells showed no obvious difference. These results indicate two points of information, (1) stress responses mostly happened in fast‐expanding cells; (2) pure HSCs are more sensitive to ER stress response. In support of our finding, TM‐induced ER stress causes more apoptosis in human HSCs compared to progenitors (van Galen et al., 2014).\n\nCHOP, also named ddit3, is involved in DNA damage response through a unique pathway independent of either protein kinase C or tyrosine kinase. Previous study showed that CHOP may indirectly promote neuronal survival by restraining p53 induction via MDM2 upregulation (Engel et al., 2013). Our study showed that CHOP deficiency increases the percentage of donor‐derived cells after IR in vivo and in vitro, implying CHOP deficiency protects HSCs from IR‐induced DNA damage. Unlike normal HSC transplantation, the percentage of donor‐derived cells in the first month did not differ with CHOP−/− HSCs IR‐irradiated with 2 Gy in vitro. This shows that IR‐induced DNA damage plays a more important role in this assay compared to the other stress responses. C/EBP homologous protein‐deficient LSK showed lower level of apoptosis and had an increased clone number after 2 Gy IR in vitro, which indicates an involvement of CHOP in IR‐induced apoptosis and suggests CHOP deficiency protects HSCs from acute DNA damage caused apoptosis in vivo and in vitro.\n\nPrevious studies showed that telomere dysfunctional mouse models exhibit an aging phenotypes with impaired HSC maintenance and function (Ju et al., 2007). P21 deficiency rescued proliferation of intestinal progenitor cells and improved the repopulation capacity and self‐renewal of hematopoietic stem cells without rescuing telomere length in telomere dysfunctional mice (Choudhury et al., 2007). Our data showed a decreased B lymphocyte number and myeloid cells expansion in BM and spleen in 7‐ to 8‐month‐old G3Terc−/− mice, while HSCs displayed a threefold increase but had an impaired function. In telomere dysfunctional CHOP‐deficient mice, we found CHOP deficiency can clearly increase B lymphocyte numbers and decrease myeloid numbers in BM and spleen. Transplantation assays further show that CHOP deficiency partly rescues the function of HSCs. While there was no difference of the ATF3 expression in G3CHOP+/+ mice and G3CHOP−/− mice (Figure S5g), these results indicate that CHOP deficiency improves HSCs homeostasis and function in telomere dysfunctional mice models, which may not through ATF3 regulating pathways. In G3Terc knockout mice, the expression of p53 is high and CHOP has been reported to regulate p53 (Engel et al., 2013). Therefore, CHOP may regulate p53 to rescue the G3Terc knockout mice phenotype.\n\nThe vascular endothelial cells that provide support for HSC are affected by 5‐FU treatment and respond to HSC in a similar manner during recovery or aging (Xie et al., 2009). Megakaryocytes serve as HSC‐derived niche cells to maintain HSC quiescence and promote post‐injury regeneration through TGF‐b–SMAD signaling. CHOP−/− and also Terc−/− mice which have a global knockout in hematopoietic cells (Zhao et al., 2014). CHOP−/− mice may also provide a “rejuvenated” environment supportive of HSC expansion and maintenance after 5‐FU treatment or aging.\n\nEven though CHOP deficiency HSCs expand better and have less accumulation of unfold proteins, while CHOP deficiency has a bad effect in some other tissues and organs. Such as in brain, CHOP promotes neuronal survival from epilepsy by restraining p53 (Engel et al., 2013). C/EBP homologous protein deficiency causes obesity in female mice. Sometimes, evolution is aimed for the better continuation of species, not for individual survival.\n\nIn summary, our study provides a novel concept of how CHOP deficiency protects HSCs from replication stress and DNA damage‐induced apoptosis. C/EBP homologous protein deficiency reduces ATF3 expression, protein synthesis rate, and ROS synthesis, which cause CHOP‐mediated apoptosis (Figure 5n). In telomere dysfunctional mice, CHOP deficiency rescued HSCs homeostasis and function. The HSC niche can also be influenced by CHOP−/− and provide a “rejuvenated” environment supportive of HSC expansion and maintenance after 5‐FU treatment or aging. C/EBP homologous protein deficiency improves HSCs function in all kind of stress response through ATF3/ROS axis.",

    "title": "SARS–CoV–2 Spike Impairs DNA Damage Repair and Inhibits V(D)J Recombination In Vitro",
    "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV–2) has led to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic, severely affecting public health and the global economy. Adaptive immunity plays a crucial role in fighting against SARS–CoV–2 infection and directly influences the clinical outcomes of patients. Clinical studies have indicated that patients with severe COVID–19 exhibit delayed and weak adaptive immune responses; however, the mechanism by which SARS–CoV–2 impedes adaptive immunity remains unclear. Here, by using an in vitro cell line, we report that the SARS–CoV–2 spike protein significantly inhibits DNA damage repair, which is required for effective V(D)J recombination in adaptive immunity. Mechanistically, we found that the spike protein localizes in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair by impeding key DNA repair protein BRCA1 and 53BP1 recruitment to the damage site. Our findings reveal a potential molecular mechanism by which the spike protein might impede adaptive immunity and underscore the potential side effects of full-length spike-based vaccines.\n\nAs two critical host surveillance systems, the immune and DNA repair systems are the primary systems that higher organisms rely on for defense against diverse threats and tissue homeostasis. Emerging evidence indicates that these two systems are interdependent, especially during lymphocyte development and maturation [ 7 ]. As one of the major double-strand DNA break (DSB) repair pathways, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair plays a critical role in lymphocyte–specific recombination–activating gene endonuclease (RAG) –mediated V(D)J recombination, which results in a highly diverse repertoire of antibodies in B cell and T cell receptors (TCRs) in T cells [ 8 ]. For example, loss of function of key DNA repair proteins such as ATM, DNA–PKcs, 53BP1, et al., leads to defects in the NHEJ repair which inhibit the production of functional B and T cells, leading to immunodeficiency [ 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 ]. In contrast, viral infection usually induces DNA damage via different mechanisms, such as inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and host cell replication stress [ 12 , 13 , 14 ]. If DNA damage cannot be properly repaired, it will contribute to the amplification of viral infection-induced pathology. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether SARS–CoV–2 proteins hijack the DNA damage repair system, thereby affecting adaptive immunity in vitro.\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV–2) is responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic that has resulted in more than 2.3 million deaths. SARS–CoV–2 is an enveloped single positive–sense RNA virus that consists of structural and non–structural proteins [ 1 ]. After infection, these viral proteins hijack and dysregulate the host cellular machinery to replicate, assemble, and spread progeny viruses [ 2 ]. Recent clinical studies have shown that SARS–CoV–2 infection extraordinarily affects lymphocyte number and function [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. Compared with mild and moderate survivors, patients with severe COVID–19 manifest a significantly lower number of total T cells, helper T cells, and suppressor T cells [ 3 , 4 ]. Additionally, COVID–19 delays IgG and IgM levels after symptom onset [ 5 , 6 ]. Collectively, these clinical observations suggest that SARS–CoV–2 affects the adaptive immune system. However, the mechanism by which SARS–CoV–2 suppresses adaptive immunity remains unclear.\n\nBriefly, V(D)J reporter plasmid contains inverted-GFP and IRES driving continuously expressed RFP. Continuously expressed RFP is the internal transfection control. After Recombination activation gene1/2 (RAG1/2) co–transfected into the cells, RAG1/2 will cut the RSS and mediated induction of DSBs, if V(D)J recombination occurs, the inverted GFPs are ligated in positive order by NHEJ repair. Then the cell will express functional GFP. So, the GFP and RFP double positive cells are the readout of the V(D)J reporter assay [ 18 ]. 293T cells at 70% confluency were transfected with the V(D)J GFP reporter alone (background) or in combination with RAG1 and RAG2 expression constructs, at a ratio of 1 µg V(D)J GFP reporter: 0.5 µg RAG1: 0.5 µg RAG2. The following day, the medium was changed, and after an additional 48 h, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP and RFP expression.\n\nCells were seeded on glass coverslips in a 12–well plate and transfected with the indicated plasmid for 24 h. Then, the cells were treated with or without DNA damage reagents according to the experimental setup. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 20 min at RT and then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X–100 for 10 min. Slides were blocked in 5% normal goat serum (NGS) and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 1% NGS overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated with the indicated secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 (Invitrogen) diluted in 1% NGS at RT for 1 h. Thereafter, they were stained with DAPI for 15 min at RT. Coverslips were mounted using Dako Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Agilent) and imaged using a Nikon confocal microscope (Eclipse C1 Plus). All scoring was performed under blinded conditions.\n\nCells were treated with different DNA damage reagents and then harvested at the indicated time points for analysis. Cells (1 × 10 5 cells/mL in cold phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) were resuspended in 1% low–melting agarose at 40 °C at a ratio of 1:3 vol/vol and pipetted onto a CometSlide. Slides were then immersed in prechilled lysis buffer (1.2 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium lauryl sarcosinate, 0.26 M NaOH pH > 13) for overnight (18–20 h) lysis at 4 °C in the dark. Slides were then carefully removed and submerged in rinse buffer (0.03 M NaOH and 2 mM EDTA, pH > 12) at room temperature (RT) for 20 min in the dark. This washing step was repeated twice. The slides were transferred to a horizontal electrophoresis chamber containing rinse buffer and separated for 25 min at a voltage of 0.6 V/cm. Finally, the slides were washed with distilled water, stained with 10 μg/mL propidium iodide, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Twenty fields with approximately 100 cells in each sample were evaluated and quantified using the Fiji software to determine the tail length (tail moment).\n\nFor the cellular fraction assay, the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein lysates were quantified using the BCA reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham protran, 0.45 μm NC), and immunoblotted with specific primary antibodies followed by HRP–conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein bands were detected using SuperSignal West Pico or Femto Chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nHR and NHEJ repair in HEK293T cells were measured as described previously using DR–GFP and EJ5–GFP stable cells. Briefly, 0.5 × 10 6 HEK293T stable reporter cells were seeded in 6–well plates and transfected with 2 μg I–SceI expression plasmid (pCBASceI) together with SARS–CoV–2 proteins expression plasmids. Forty–eight hours post–transfection and aspirin treatment, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry analysis for GFP expression. The means were obtained from three independent experiments.\n\nHEK293T and HEK293 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were cultured under 5% CO 2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, high glucose, GlutaMAX) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco), 1% (v/v) penicillin (100 IU/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL). HEK293T–DR–GFP and HEK293T–EJ5–GFP reporter cells were generated as previously described and cultured under 5% CO 2 at 37 °C in the above-mentioned culture medium.\n\npHPRT–DRGFP and pCBASceI were kindly gifted by Maria Jasin (Addgene plasmids #26476 and #26477) [ 15 ]. pimEJ5GFP was a gift from Jeremy Stark (Addgene plasmid #44026) [ 16 ]. The NSP1, NSP9, NSP13, NSP14, NSP16, spike, and nucleocapsid proteins were first synthesized with codon optimization and then cloned into a mammalian expression vector pUC57 with a C–terminal 6xHis tag. A 12–spacer RSS–GFP inverted complementary sequence–a 23–spacer RSS was synthesized for the V(D)J reporter vector. Then, the sequence was cloned into the pBabe–IRES–mRFP vector to generate the pBabe–12RSS–GFPi–23RSS–IRES–mRFP reporter vector. 12–spacer RSS sequence: 5′–CACAGTGCTACAGACTGGAACAAAAACC–3′. 23–spacer RSS sequence: 5′–CACAGTGGTAGTACTCCACTGTCTGGCTGTACAAAAACC–3′. RAG1 and RAG2 expression constructs were generously gifted by Martin Gellert (Addgene plasmid #13328 and #13329) [ 17 ].\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effect of Nuclear–Localized SARS–CoV–2 Viral Proteins on DNA Damage Repair DNA damage repair occurs mainly in the nucleus to ensure genome stability. Although SARS–CoV–2 proteins are synthesized in the cytosol [1], some viral proteins are also detectable in the nucleus, including Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp9, Nsp13, Nsp14, and Nsp16 [19]. We investigated whether these nuclear-localized SARS–CoV–2 proteins affect the host cell DNA damage repair system. For this, we constructed these viral protein expression plasmids together with spike and nucleoprotein expression plasmids, which are generally considered cytosol–localized proteins. We confirmed their expression and localization by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence (Figure 1A and Figure S1A). Our results were consistent with those from previous studies [19]; Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp9, Nsp13, Nsp14, and Nsp16 proteins are indeed localized in the nucleus, and nucleoproteins are mainly localized in the cytosol. Surprisingly, we found the abundance of the spike protein in the nucleus (Figure 1A). NHEJ repair and homologous recombination (HR) repair are two major DNA repair pathways that not only continuously monitor and ensure genome integrity but are also vital for adaptive immune cell functions [9]. To evaluate whether these viral proteins impede the DSB repair pathway, we examined the repair of a site-specific DSB induced by the I–SceI endonuclease using the direct repeat–green fluorescence protein (DR–GFP) and the total-NHEJ-GFP (EJ5–GFP) reporter systems for HR and NHEJ, respectively [15,16]. Overexpression of Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, and spike proteins diminished the efficiencies of both HR and NHEJ repair (Figure 1B–E and Figure S2A,B). Moreover, we also found that Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp13, and Nsp14 overexpression dramatically suppressed proliferation compared with other studied proteins (Figure S3A,B). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp13, and Nsp14 on DNA damage repair may be due to secondary effects, such as growth arrest and cell death. Interestingly, overexpressed spike protein did not affect cell morphology or proliferation but significantly suppressed both HR and NHEJ repair (Figure 1B–E, Figures S2A,B and S3A,B). Figure 1.

SARS–CoV–2 Spike Protein Inhibits DNA Damage Repair Because spike proteins are critical for mediating viral entry into host cells and are the focus of most vaccine strategies [20,21], we further investigated the role of spike proteins in DNA damage repair and its associated V(D)J recombination. Spike proteins are usually thought to be synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [1]. After posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, spike proteins traffic via the cellular membrane apparatus together with other viral proteins to form the mature virion [1]. Spike protein contains two major subunits, S1 and S2, as well as several functional domains or repeats [22] (Figure 2A). In the native state, spike proteins exist as inactive full–length proteins. During viral infection, host cell proteases such as furin protease activate the S protein by cleaving it into S1 and S2 subunits, which is necessary for viral entry into the target cell [23]. We further explored different subunits of the spike protein to elucidate the functional features required for DNA repair inhibition. Only the full–length spike protein strongly inhibited both NHEJ and HR repair (Figure 2B–E and Figure S4A,B). Next, we sought to determine whether the spike protein directly contributes to genomic instability by inhibiting DSB repair. We monitored the levels of DSBs using comet assays. Following different DNA damage treatments, such as γ–irradiation, doxorubicin treatment, and H 2 O 2 treatment, there is less repair in the presence of the spike protein (Figure 2F,G). Together, these data demonstrate that the spike protein directly affects DNA repair in the nucleus. Figure 2.

The S2 subunit consists of the fusion peptide (FP, 788–806 residues), heptapeptide repeat sequence 1 (HR1, 912–984 residues), HR2 (1163–1213 residues), TM domain (TM, 1213–1237 residues), and cytoplasm domain (CT,1237–1273 residues).

Spike Proteins Impede the Recruitment of DNA Damage Repair Checkpoint Proteins To confirm the existence of spike protein in the nucleus, we performed subcellular fraction analysis and found that spike proteins are not only enriched in the cellular membrane fraction but are also abundant in the nuclear fraction, with detectable expression even in the chromatin–bound fraction (Figure 3A). We also observed that the spike has three different forms, the higher band is a highly glycosylated spike, the middle one is a full–length spike, and the lower one is a cleaved spike subunit. Consistent with the comet assay, we also found the upregulation of the DNA damage marker, γ–H2A.X, in spike protein–overexpressed cells under DNA damage conditions (Figure 3B). A recent study suggested that spike proteins induce ER stress and ER–associated protein degradation [24]. To exclude the possibility that the spike protein inhibits DNA repair by promoting DNA repair protein degradation, we checked the expression of some essential DNA repair proteins in NHEJ and HR repair pathways and found that these DNA repair proteins were stable after spike protein overexpression (Figure 3C). To determine how the spike protein inhibits both NHEJ and HR repair pathways, we analyzed the recruitment of BRCA1 and 53BP1, which are the key checkpoint proteins for HR and NHEJ repair, respectively. We found that the spike protein markedly inhibited both BRCA1 and 53BP1 foci formation (Figure 3D–G). Together, these data show that the SARS–CoV–2 full–length spike protein inhibits DNA damage repair by hindering DNA repair protein recruitment. Figure 3.

    "title": "Amino Acid Profile in Malnourished Patients with Liver Cirrhosis and Its Modification with Oral Nutritional Supplements: Implications on Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy",
    "text": "Abstract Low plasma levels of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) in liver cirrhosis are associated with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). We aimed to identify a metabolic signature of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) in malnourished cirrhotic patients and evaluate its modification with oral nutritional supplements (ONS) enriched with ß-Hydroxy-ß-methylbutyrate (HMB), a derivative of the BCAA leucine. Post hoc analysis was conducted on a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 43 individuals with cirrhosis and malnutrition, who were randomized to receive, for 12 weeks, oral supplementation twice a day with either 220 mL of Ensure® Plus Advance (HMB group, n = 22) or with 220 mL of Ensure® Plus High Protein (HP group, n = 21). MHE evaluation was by psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES). Compared to the HP group, an HMB-specific treatment effect led to a larger increase in Val, Leu, Phe, Trp and BCAA fasting plasma levels. Both treatments increased Fischer’s ratio and urea without an increase in Gln or ammonia fasting plasma levels. MHE was associated with a reduced total plasma amino acid concentration, a reduced BCAA and Fischer´s ratio, and an increased Gln/Glu ratio. HMB-enriched ONS increased Fischer´s ratio without varying Gln or ammonia plasma levels in liver cirrhosis and malnutrition, a protective amino acid profile that can help prevent MHE. Keywords: HMB, hydroxymethylbutyrate, clinical trial, PCA\n\n1. Introduction Malnutrition in cirrhosis is characterized by an increase in fatty acid oxidation, reduced utilization of glucose as energy source, and decreased protein synthesis. All these processes converge into a loss of muscle mass [1]. Gluconeogenesis is increased in early stages of liver cirrhosis and the skeletal muscle is the main source of amino acids by proteolysis. As a result, both aromatic (AAA) and branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are generated [2]. BCAA are catabolized in the skeletal muscle and AAA are primarily metabolized in the liver. As a consequence, plasma BCAA concentrations and Fischer´s ratio (BCAA/AAA) are reduced in cirrhotic patients [2,3,4]. The reduced concentration of amino acids in the muscle cells activates proteolysis via autophagy [2]. Hyperammonemia plays a crucial role in increased BCAA catabolism and decreased plasma BCAA concentrations in liver cirrhosis [5]. Moreover, hyperammonemia in cirrhosis also contributes to the inhibition of protein synthesis and the activation of autophagy [2,6]. Physiologically, glutamate (Glu) serves as an anaplerotic substrate in most tissues to generate α-ketoglutarate, and this reaction is catalyzed bidirectionally by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase [2]. However, in cirrhosis due to impaired ureagenesis, the skeletal muscle is the main ammonia-detoxifying system by increasing the activity of glutamine synthetase [2,7]. As consequence, Glu and ammonia form glutamine (Gln) and consume α-ketoglutarate [8]. Most of the Gln produced is released to the blood and catabolized in enterocytes and kidneys to ammonia [9]. This Gln synthesis and Gln breakdown in liver cirrhosis plays a vicious cycle in the development of hyperammonemia and in the decrease in BCAA levels [10]. Ultimately, increased blood ammonia levels causes astroglial swelling leading to neurological or psychiatric alterations known as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) [11]. In sarcopenia, due to low muscle mass, non-hepatic disposal of ammonia is impaired, which may cause HE more frequently [12]. HE is divided into two broad categories based on severity, covert or minimal (MHE) and overt [13]. MHE has a significant impact on a patient´s quality of life, increasing hospitalizations and death [14]. The psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) is a validated, gold standard tool to evaluate MHE [15]. Supplementation with leucine (Leu), a BCAA, actives protein synthesis via mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) [16]. Moreover, BCAA supplementation promotes ammonia detoxification in skeletal muscle via α-ketoglutarate and serves as an anaplerotic substrate in muscle and brain [17]. Clinically, BCAAs in liver cirrhosis have been associated with symptomatic improvement of hepatic encephalopathy and decreased incidence of ascites and infections [18]. An additional increase in muscle strength has also been observed [18]. From studies of amino acid oxidation [19], it has been advised that BCAA supplementation in liver cirrhosis be carried out in the proportions 2:1:1 (Leu:Ile:Val) [20]. Supplementing with leucine alone could increase the oxidation of other BCAAs, worsening muscle protein balance [21]. ß-Hydroxy-ß-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a naturally occurring and metabolically active derivative of the BCAA Leu [22]. HMB stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits the ubiquitin–proteasome system [23], and is more effective than Leu in increasing protein synthesis through the mTOR system [24]. HMB also increases the activity of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) in muscle-wasting disorders such as liver cirrhosis. This results in the oxidation of Leu as source of energy, increasing acetyl-CoA and impairing HMB production [7]. Recent studies have shown that 12-week HMB supplementation improved muscle performance in compensated cirrhotic patients [25] and increased plasma BCAA in cirrhotic and partially hepatectomized rats [26,27]. However, the effect of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) with HMB on the amino acid profile of patients with decompensated cirrhosis has not been studied. We therefore conducted a pilot randomized clinical trial aimed at analyzing the effect of HMB in the clinical setting of liver cirrhosis and malnutrition (Espina S. Unpublished results). In this post hoc study we aimed to identify a metabolic signature of MHE in malnourished cirrhotic patients and evaluate its modification with ONS.\n\n2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Population This post hoc study is part of a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (NCT03285217 at ClinicalTrials.gov) performed in the University Hospital Miguel Servet (Zaragoza, Spain) that enrolled patients with liver cirrhosis of any etiology, with 1 previous decompensation, and clinical malnutrition screened by SGA (Subjective Global Assessment) [28]. Exclusion criteria were being <18 years old or having diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid treatment, hepatocellular carcinoma, uncontrolled infection, orthotopic liver transplantation, recent (<3 months) overt hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Participants were randomized into one of two study groups with a 1:1 ratio via permuted-block randomization with random block size using the package blockrand of R. Participants randomly received, twice a day and for 12 weeks, ONS of either 220 mL of Ensure® Plus Advance (HMB group; 1.5 kcal/mL, 24.3% protein, 28.8% fat, and 1.5 g of calcium HMB per service) or 220 mL of Ensure® Plus High Protein (HP group; 1.25 kcal/mL, 25.3% protein, 23.8% fat). Supplementary Table S1 shows the amino acid content of each oral supplement. This trial was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee (CEIC-A, ref. PI17/0258). All study participants provided written informed consent before participating in the trial. Amino acid profiles, along with sex and age, from otherwise healthy unidentified noncirrhotic individuals were provided by the Clinical Biochemistry Department at the University Hospital Miguel Servet. No informed consent was sought from those individuals due to the use of anonymized data. 2.2. Outcome Measures Both groups were evaluated at the same time points: baseline (pretreatment), 6 weeks after the start of the ONS, and at the end of the treatment (12 weeks). At each visit, laboratory (fasting venous sampling) and clinical assessments were carried out. MHE was evaluated using the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), a battery of paper-pencil tests evaluating cognitive and psychomotor processing speed as well as visuomotor coordination [15]. Liver status was assessed with (1) Child–Pugh score [29] which uses five clinical measures of liver disease (total bilirrubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time, ascites, and HE). Each measure was scored 1–3 according to well-established cutoffs, with 3 indicating most severe derangement. A further classification into classes A (5–6 points), B (7–9 points), and C (10–15 point) was carried out [30] and (2) MELD score [31], which is used to assess the severity of chronic liver diseases according to a formula that includes values for serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the international normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR). Amino acids in plasma were identified using cation-exchange chromatography by post-column ninhydrin derivatization on the Biochrom 30+ Amino Acid analyzer (Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Five different lithium citrate elution buffers were used to separate the amino acids, and a postcolumn reaction with ninhydrin formed a dye complex with the amino acids. UV detection of amino acids was obtained at two wavelengths, 570 nm and 440 nm, according to the type of the amino acids determined [32,33]. BCAA was calculated as the sum of Leu, Ile and Val. AAA was calculated as the sum of Phe, Tyr and Trp. Fischer´s ratio was calculated as the sum of Leu, Ile and Val divided by the sum of Phe and Tyr. Gln/Glu ratio was calculated as Gln divided by Glu. 2.3. Statistical Analyses Statistical analysis was carried out in R 3.4.3. and the appropriate packages according to the predefined statistical analysis plan. Categorical data were presented as number of cases and percentages and compared using the Chi-squared tests with Yates correction. Continuous data were described as median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) and comparisons were performed with Mann–Whitney U-tests. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with the FactoMineR and factoextra packages using scaled data. Variable contributions for a given principal component were expressed in percentage. Longitudinal variations were modeled using linear mixed-effects models (LMM) for repeated measures using the lme function of the nlme package to take into consideration the repeated assessment of each variable. Missing values in outcome variables were not imputed. LMM models produced different p-values that captured the variation over time of each variable for the entire cohort (p long ) and treatment-specific longitudinal changes, that is, the interaction between longitudinal changes and treatment (p long*treatment ). Values of p long*treatment < 0.1 were considered as hypothesis-generating.\n\n3. Results 3.1. Specific Plasma Amino Acid Profile in Cirrhotic Patients Firstly, we sought to investigate the difference in plasma amino acid profile between cirrhotic patients with clinical malnutrition (n = 43) and healthy individuals (n = 31) matched for age and sex. Patients with cirrhosis had lower plasma concentration of phosphoserine, Asn, Gln, Val, and cystine while those of taurine, Asp, Ser, Glu, aminoadipic acid, Gly, Met, Tyr, beta-alanine, Phe, etanolamine, ornithine, Arg, Trp, His, 3-methylhistidine, and hydroxyproline (Hyp) were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients than in their healthy counterparts (Table 1).

The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 0.76 and the Bartlett´s test of sphericity rejected the null hypothesis of the test, i.e., that the variables were orthogonal (p < 0.001). Five PCs with eigenvalues >1 were identified and their percentage of explained variance is represented in Figure 1A. To evaluate their performance, the Mann–Whitney U-test was used to compare each PC score between the healthy and cirrhotic individuals. Both PC1 and PC2 showed significant p values (< 0.001) and their score plots showed a clear discrimination between cirrhotic and healthy subjects on the basis of their amino acid profile (Figure 1B). Next, we extracted the contribution of each individual amino acid towards the PCs. The results identified Arg, Phe, Asp, and Ser as the most contributing factors for PC1 (Figure 1C) while Val, Lys, Ala, and Leu were the most important contributors for PC2 (Figure 1D). Figure 1.

Baseline Characteristics of Cirrhotic Patients before Oral Nutritional Supplementation Forty-three patients with cirrhosis were randomized to receive ONS twice a day with either 220 mL of Ensure® Plus Advance (HMB group, n = 22) or oral supplementation twice a day with 220 mL of Ensure® Plus High Protein (HP group, n = 21). At the time of enrollment, there were no significant differences between treatment groups with respect to age, sex or prevalence of ascites. Alcohol addiction was the main etiology of cirrhosis in both groups (Table 2). Table 2. Demographics and baseline characteristics.

The patients also underwent a nutritional assessment using the SGA scale without finding differences between the groups. Overall, 72% of the patients were evaluated as moderately malnourished (B) and the other 28% as severely malnourished (C) (Table 2). A similar amino acid profile was observed in the treatment groups at the baseline with only minor differences in the plasma concentration of Leu and Trp (Supplementary Table S2). Both amino acids appeared slightly decreased at baseline in the HMB group. 3.3. Longitudinal Changes in Metabolic Parameters and Amino Acids during Oral Nutritional Supplementation A total of 108 amino acid profiles were assayed during the ONS treatment. Both ONS treatments during 12 weeks increased the plasma levels of Asp (p long = 0.001), Ala (p long = 0.004), citruline (p long = 0.03), Val (p long = 0.004), Met (p long = 0.03), Leu (p long = 0.01), Tyr (p long = 0.001), Phe (p long = 0.001), Lys (p long = 0.031), and Trp (p long = 0.008). Compared with the HP group, an HMB-specific treatment effect led to a larger increase in Val (35% vs. 13%, p long*treatment = 0.055), Leu (27% vs. 1%, p long*treatment = 0.035), Phe (36% vs. 0%, p long*treatment = 0.057), and Trp (35% vs. 11%, p long*treatment = 0.066) (Table 3).

Each point represents a single subject. Boxes are drawn from Q1 to Q3 with a horizontal line drawn in the middle to denote the median. Plasma BCAA levels (sum of leucine, isoleucine and valine) increased significantly (p long = 0.012) during both treatments. However, this increase was larger in the HMB group compared with the HP group (25% vs. 3%, p long*treatment = 0.046). AAA levels (sum of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan) increased significantly at the end of both treatments (p long = 0.003) without differences between treatment groups (Table 3). Supplementary Table S3 shows the variations for all plasma amino acid. During follow-up the plasma urea levels increased significantly at the end of the trial (p long = 0.048), with no differences between treatments. Ammonia plasma levels did not increase significantly at the end of the trial (p long = 0.11). 3.4. Amino Acid Signature of the Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy Overall, 29% of the patients presented MHE during the baseline assessment while this percentage decreased to 21% after 12 weeks of ONS (p = 0.32). Interestingly, HMB treatment reduced the MHE prevalence from 38% to 21% (p = 0.16) while no reduction was observed in the HP group (19% in the baseline and 21% after treatment. p = 1). 108 amino acid profiles were obtained and 26 MHE events were documented during follow-up. Table 4 shows the metabolic profiles, closest in time to the MHE event, compared to those analyses that were not associated with any event. MHE events were associated with reduced total plasma amino acid concentration (calculated as the sum of all amino acid levels); 2.9 mM [2.6; 3.2] vs. 3.2 mM [2.9; 3.6] in the absence of MHE (p = 0.011). For the individual amino acids, significant lower plasma levels of taurine, Asp, Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Phe, and Arg were associated with MHE. In general, a reduced BCAA and Fischer´s ratio and an increased Gln/Glu ratio occurred simultaneously during the MHE events. Table 4.

Discussion Portosystemic shunt and impaired ornithine cycle activity in cirrhosis lead to skeletal muscle depletion and impaired ammonia detoxification causing hepatic encephalopathy [1]. This condition may be aggravated by malnutrition [12]. We observed that the amino acid signature associated with MHE was characterized by a 24% reduction in BCAA and a 19.5% lower Fischer’s ratio, while the Gln/Glu ratio increased by 38.3% compared to those without MHE. Our study showed that oral nutritional supplementation for 12 weeks with either HMB or HP treatments increased plasma levels of AAA, Ala, and urea without increasing Gln or ammonia. Interestingly, only oral supplementation with HMB increased plasma levels of BCAA. There is ample evidence of the profound effects of liver disease on amino acid metabolism. Pioneering studies had shown long ago that increased concentrations of methionine and AAA with decreased concentrations BCAA were associated with liver cirrhosis [34,35]. Here, we also found elevated Hyp in cirrhotic patients, formed by post-translational hydroxylation of proline and biomarkers of liver fibrosis [36]. Additionally, by using a multivariate (PCA) analysis we were able to include Arg, Asp, Ser, Lys, and Ala in the metabolic profile to distinguish healthy from malnourished cirrhotic patients. Hyperammonemia is a consequence of portosystemic shunting and hepatocellular dysfunction, the skeletal muscle being the main system for ammonia detoxification in liver cirrhosis [2]. Hyperammonemia has been shown to be associated with the pathogenesis of complications related to cirrhosis, such as hepatic encephalopathy [37]. Beyond hyperammonemia, our results also agree with other metabolic routes previously described to be associated with HE. Thus, the decreased Fisher´s ratio may cause an imbalance in the synthesis of neurotransmitters [38] while increased Gln correlates with astrocyte swelling [11]. Reduced levels of taurine and Arg may indicate an impairment in the trans-sulphuration pathway which consumes hCys, a well-known risk factor for dementia [39,40,41]. Clinically, BCAA supplementation in liver cirrhosis have been associated with symptomatic improvement of hepatic encephalopathy [42,43]. Most studies indicate that administration of BCAA in cirrhosis has no effect or decreases ammonia [20]. However, Dam et al. observed a significant increase in arterial blood concentrations of ammonia and Gln flux from muscles in cirrhotic patients compared to healthy subjects after the intake of BCAA [44]. However, BCAA supplementation increased plasma BCAA levels to a lesser extent in cirrhosis than in healthy individuals. Holecek et al. described an increase in plasma and muscle levels of BCAA, Ala, and Gln in healthy rats orally supplemented with BCAA [21]. Interestingly, only oral supplementation with HMB increased plasma levels of BCAA although BCAA is also found in the High Protein ONS. We hypothesize that HMB is increasing plasma levels of BCAA via a direct effect on protein synthesis and inhibition of protein breakdown. Alternatively, HMB might also decrease gluconeogenesis [45] and consequently reduce the utilization of BCAA as gluconeogenic precursors. HMB is a naturally occurring and metabolically active derivative of the BCAA leucine. Mounting evidence supports that ONS with HMB can increase muscle mass and strength and reduce muscle damage during resistance exercises [22,46,47,48], as well as prevent muscle loss in the elderly [49,50]. However, there are few clinical reports of the effects of ONS enriched with HMB on other muscle-wasting diseases [23] and specifically there are no data on the clinical impact of HMB in liver cirrhosis or its effects on plasma amino acid profiles. Holecek et al. conducted a study in healthy rats to examine the role of exogenous HMB on Leu and protein metabolism, and they observed an increase in plasma Leu levels as a result of a decrease in its clearance, as well as a decrease in plasma levels of Ala, Gln, and Glu [51]. We found several trends that can help focus future research. HMB supplementation increased fasting plasma levels of the essential amino acids Val, Leu, Phe, and Trp. We did not observe those changes in the HP group. It can be argued that the HMB group received the Ensure® Plus Advance formula with a slightly higher dose of amino acids than Ensure® Plus High Protein (HP treatment). However, the magnitude of the increases (27–35%) almost doubled the differences in the composition (13–20%). Both ONS increased the plasma levels of AAA (p = 0.003), Ala (p = 0.004) and urea (p = 0.048), without increasing the plasma levels of ammonia (p = 0.11) or Gln (p = 0.932). Fischer´s ratio increased significantly at the end of the study (p = 0.013) without differences between treatments, although an upward trend was observed in the HMB group. We also study the Gln/Glu ratio because an increased ratio has been associated with a deterioration of brain function [52] but no significant differences were found at the end of the trial for either of the two treatments (p = 0.31). We found that the presence of MHE was associated with (1) reduced total plasma amino acid concentration, likely associated with an impaired nutritional status, (2) reduced BCAA and Fischer´s ratio, and (3) increased Gln/Glu ratio. This amino acid signature may be used to evaluate potential treatments to reduce the incidence of MHE in malnourished patients with liver cirrhosis. In this vein, our study showed that MHE events were nearly halved in individuals supplemented with HMB-enriched ONS after 12 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, HMB-enriched ONS increased Fischer´s ratio by increasing BCAA levels in a greater proportion than AAA levels, which according to previous results is associated with an improvement in the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy [3]. Our study has several limitations, mainly derived from the complexity of amino acid metabolism in the MHE context. Studying plasma concentrations of amino acids can, at best, reflect only partial aspects of this complexity. We cannot rule out some other effects beyond the observed variation at the metabolomics level. Some HMB effects may occur at the gene expression level (reviewed in [45]) and a recent report has indicated that HMB is an epigenetic regulator in muscle progenitor cells in vitro [53]. The relatively small sample size has surely limited the power to find statistically significant associations. However, we find value in the overall description of these little-studied relationships. Taken together, the findings were consistent and this study will serve as an exploratory analysis for other potential linkages.\n\n5. Conclusions The main conclusion for this work is that HMB-enriched ONS increased the Fischer´s ratio in patients with liver cirrhosis and malnutrition without varying Gln or ammonia plasma levels, a protective amino acid profile that can help prevent MHE.\n\nAcknowledgments We want to acknowledge the contribution of P.P.

    "title": "Association Between Epilepsy and Leigh Syndrome With MT-ND3 Mutation, Particularly the m.10191T>C Point Mutation",
    "text": "Results: The nucleotide changes in the seven patients with the Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation were divided into two groups: m.10191T>C and m.10158T>C. Six of the seven patients were found to have the m.10191T>C mutations. The median value of the mutant load was 82.5%, ranging from 57.9 to 93.6%. No particular tendency was observed for the first symptom or seizure onset or mutant load. The six patients with the m.10191T>C mutation were diagnosed with epilepsy. Three of these patients were diagnosed with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS).\n\nIn total, mutations in 14 mitochondrial genes are known to be associated with Leigh syndrome (MT-ATP6, MT-CO3, MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND3, MT-ND4, MT-ND5, MT-ND6, MT-T1, MT-TK, MT-TL1, MT-TL2, MT-TV, and MT-TW) ( 4 ). Genotype–phenotype studies of each of these mutations are currently underway. Among them, several studies have found that Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation (hereafter referred as Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation) is strongly associated with epilepsy ( 6 – 8 ). This knowledge may assist neurologists with the development of treatment plans and prognosis predictions for the patients with Leigh syndrome with the MT-ND3 mutation.\n\nLeigh syndrome (or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is the most common clinical syndrome of mitochondrial disease that occurs in the pediatric patients. Leigh syndrome is further divided into mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) associated and nuclear associated ( 1 – 4 ). Recent advances in molecular genetic testing approaches have led to a rapid increase in the understanding of the genetics of Leigh syndrome. Due to this comprehensive genomic testing, a genotype–phenotype correlation has been actively attempted according to the genetic mutations of Leigh syndrome. In particular, the genotype–phenotype correlation of mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome is more challenging, as heteroplasmy must be considered and genetic mutation type ( 2 – 5 ).\n\nThe genetic and clinical characteristics of the seven patients with Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation are given in Table 1 . Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0 for Windows (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA). Descriptive statistics were used including the median and range. The mutation load of mtDNA in each patient was displayed as a percentage and treated as a continuous variable for statistical analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to see the correlation between two continuous variables. The statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05.\n\nThe PCR product was fragmented into 150–200 base pair (bp) segments with a NEBNext dsDNA Fragmentase ® (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA), according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The enzyme-fragmented PCR product was used as an input to the Accel-NGS ® 2S PCR-free DNA Library Kit, following the protocol of the manufacturer. The final libraries were evaluated on the 4,200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) and quantified using Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Libraries were sequenced via synthesis on Miseq for paired 150-bp read lengths using the Illumina MiSeq V3 Kits (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) ( 15 – 17 ).\n\nPathogenic mutations, including point mutations and large deletions, can occur in the mitochondrial genome. Therefore, the diagnosis of mtDNA-related Leigh syndrome should include the detection and quantification of sequence changes at any position of the mitochondrial genome ( 12 ). Whole mitochondrial gene sequence analysis was performed on all the patients who were clinically diagnosed with Leigh syndrome in this study. NGS technology was used to genetically confirm mtDNA Leigh syndrome and quantify the heteroplasmic mutant load of mtDNA. The sequence results were compared with the human mitochondrial reference (GenBank ID: NC_012920.1 ) ( 12 – 14 ).\n\nThe plasma lactate levels of the patients were obtained and defined as mild, moderate, or severe, if they were higher than the normal reference value by at least 2-fold, 3-fold, or 4-fold, respectively ( 9 , 10 ). These values were evaluated as sequential variables ranging from one to four. Muscle biopsies were also performed on the patients and observed under light and electron microscopes. Light microscopy revealed specific findings for mitochondrial diseases such as ragged red fibers and electron microscopy revealed pleoconia and megaconia. In addition, muscle biopsy samples were processed using routine immunohistochemical staining ( 9 ).\n\nThe clinical manifestations of Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation included in this study were reviewed. The first symptoms at disease onset and organ involvement at the time of the last follow-up were investigated as general characteristics of the patients. Patients were divided into two groups according to the criteria of early-onset Leigh syndrome: (1) <24 months old and (2) >24 months old when the first symptom occurred. The first symptom at disease onset was used to identify the most dominant symptom in the patients. For organ involvement at the time of the last follow-up, all the organs involved in Leigh syndrome, including the central nervous system (CNS), muscles, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease, motility disorders), endocrine system, kidneys (e.g., tubular acidosis), eyes (e.g., optic atrophy, ptosis), ears, and skeletal system, were checked.\n\nPatients with mtDNA mutations who were clinically diagnosed with Leigh syndrome between 2006 and 2018 at the Mitochondrial Disease Clinic of Gangnam Severance Hospital in the Republic of Korea were selected. The clinical diagnosis of Leigh syndrome was based on stringent diagnostic criteria described by Rahman et al. ( 2 – 4 ). The criteria is outlined as follows: presentation of a progressive neurological disease with symptoms of motor and intellectual developmental delays, signs and symptoms of brainstem and/or basal ganglia disease, raised lactate concentrations in the blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and bilateral symmetric hyperintense signal abnormality in the brainstem and/or basal ganglia shown on T2-weighted images in MRI of the brain. Sequencing of whole mtDNA was performed in all the patients clinically diagnosed with Leigh syndrome using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Among them, 31 patients were genetically diagnosed with mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome and among these, 7 patients with MT-ND3 mutations were detected. Each parent received a detailed explanation of this study and signed an informed consent form before their child participated in this study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine (3-2017-0168).\n\nThe prevalence of epilepsy was high in Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation (n = 6). In particular, patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (m.10191T>C mutation) were diagnosed with epilepsy and treated accordingly. The median age at first seizure was 18.2 months and ranged from 2 to 73.3 months. The seizure types consisted of two generalized tonic seizures, two focal seizures, one focal-to-secondary generalized seizure, and one mixed-type seizure. Three of the six patients with epilepsy had a history of status epilepticus. In the EEG findings at the last follow-up, the EEG patterns of Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS), such as multifocal sharp, generalized sharp and slow wave (GSSW) discharge, and generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA), were observed in three of the six patients with epilepsy (50% of the m.10191T>C mutation group, patient numbers 1, 2, and 3). These three patients had no history of infantile spasm. Five of the six patients with epilepsy were taking multiple antiseizure medications (ASMs) and two patients had attempted the ketogenic diet (KD) (lipid: nonlipid ratio: 4:1). No patients experienced serious side effects due to the ASMs, but the KD was discontinued early due to poor oral intake and GI problems in the two patients. The current seizure status compared to the initial seizure frequency was investigated and the two seizure-free patients were identified. One patient experienced > 90% reduction in seizure frequency a second patient experienced 50–90% reduction in seizure frequency, a third patient experienced < 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and a fourth patient experienced no change. The current status of deterioration was also measured and progressive deterioration was observed in four of the seven patients of Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation and the remaining three patients had a static status and no longer experienced progressive deterioration ( Table 2 ).\n\nRelationships between the onset of the first symptom, first seizure, and mutant load in the patients with the m.10191T>C mutation. (A) Relationship between the onset of the first symptom and first seizure. (B) Relationship between the onset of the first symptom and mutant load. (C) Relationship between the onset of the first seizure and mutant load.\n\nThe median value of serum lactic acidosis at diagnosis was 3.3 and ranged from 1.5 to 6.8. The serum lactic acidosis of six of the seven patients was mildly to severely increased. No specific findings were identified from muscle biopsies using light and electron microscopy. The seven patients with Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation were divided into the m.10191T>C and the m.10158T>C groups, according to the respective nucleotide change. The majority of the patients (n = 6) were in the m.10191T>C group. The median value of the mutant load was 82.5%, ranging from 57.9 to 93.6%. All the patients received mitochondrial cocktail treatment such as coenzyme, L-carnitine, and multivitamins from the time of diagnosis. No particular tendency was observed for the first symptom, first seizure onset, or mutant load. The Pearson correlation coefficient and significance level are r = 0.470, p = 0.347 in Figure 2A ; r = 0.523, p = 0.287 in Figure 2B ; and r = 0.374, p = 0.465 in Figure 2C , respectively ( Table 1 and Figure 2 ).\n\nMRI of the brain findings in the patients with Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation. This figure shows some findings from T2-weighted axial images of MRI of the brain in the patients with Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation. (A1,A2) Hyperintense signal abnormalities are observed in both the basal ganglia, brainstem, and thalamus (patient 7). (B1,B2) Hyperintense signal abnormalities in both the basal ganglia and diffuse brain atrophy prominently at bilateral frontotemporal lobes with secondary ventricular dilatation are observed (patient 2). (C1,C2) Diffuse abnormal signal changes at both the basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem are observed and diffuse brain atrophy is also observed (patient 1).\n\nAmong the seven patients with Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation, the male-to-female ratio was 2:5. The median age at first symptom onset was 12 months and ranged from 12 to 44 months. Six of the seven patients experienced early-onset Leigh syndrome and, therefore, developed symptoms before 24 months of age. The first symptoms of the patients were primarily developmental delay/regression and seizures (three patients each). The organ involvement in the patients at the time of the last follow-up was identified. CNS symptoms were observed in 100% of the patients, followed by symptoms related to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (n = 6, 85.7%) and the respiratory system (n = 6, 85.7%) and ophthalmological symptoms (n = 5, 71.4%). Normotonic or hypertonic muscle tone was observed in all the patients. Three patients had symptoms of dystonia. All the patients had gait disorder and three patients with muscle weakness could not walk at all. Among the patients, six patients were receiving enteral tube feeding, two patients underwent gastrostomy, and four patients were fed through temporary enteral tube feeding (nasogastric tube). The median age at the time of Leigh syndrome diagnosis was 22 months (range, 5–70 months). The median interval time between the development of the first symptom and Leigh syndrome diagnosis was 12 months (range, 1–44 months) ( Table 1 ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nEpilepsy is a major phenotype of mitochondrial diseases (20). In particular, Leigh syndrome is the most common mitochondrial disease in childhood and high epilepsy morbidity has been reported (21). Among the various presentations of mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome, several studies have reported a specific gene related to epilepsy. Some studies have found that m.10191T>C, a major nucleotide change in MT-ND3 gene, is strongly related to epilepsy (7, 21). In this study, the six patients with the m.10191T>C mutation were associated with epilepsy, suggesting that this mutation is important in Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation. Additionally, the results of this study suggested that even the same MT-ND3 mutation may have different phenotypes depending on the location of the point mutation. These results are supported by two important studies. Nesbitt et al. reviewed the clinical spectra of 16 patients with the m.10191T>C mutation from 14 references. This study does not describe a close relationship between epilepsy and m.10191T>C. However, after reviewing the 14 case reports used in this study, seizures were identified in 12 of the 16 (75%) patients with the m.10191T>C mutation. Their EEG findings were unknown, but most were found to be strongly associated with epilepsy. Rebecca et al. added several cases to those reviewed by Nesbitt et al. and modified the clinical features of the patients with the m.10191T>C mutation. In this study, seizures were identified in 15 out of 22 (68.2%) patients with the m.10191T>C mutation (6, 8). In addition, a recent study by Li et al. reviewed 28 patients with the m.10191T>C mutation from 23 references. Among them, 24 (85.7%) patients with the m.10191T>C mutation had epilepsy as their phenotype. Therefore, this study states that the m.10191T>C mutation may be strongly associated with epilepsy and these findings are consistent with those of this study (7). The value of this study lies in the fact that its findings are consistent with those of the previous studies and that it undertakes a more focused analysis of the characteristics of epilepsy in Leigh syndrome with the m.10191T>C mutations.\n\nLennox–Gastaut syndrome is rare and is one of the most severe forms of epilepsy with childhood onset. Epileptic discharges, known as GSSW complexes and GPFA in EEG, multiple types of seizures, and severe intellectual impairments are the diagnostic triad of LGS. LGS is one of the most complex epileptic disorders to manage, both for the pediatric neurologists and epilepsy specialists (22, 23). In a study by Lee et al., of the 372 patients with a mitochondrial disease, 40 patients were diagnosed with LGS, which represented about 10% of their study cohort (23). To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies on the relationship between LGS and mitochondrial disease or Leigh syndrome. Therefore, genotype–phenotype correlations are necessary to establish a cohort and analyze these relationships. In this study, 50% of the six patients with the m.10191T>C mutation and epilepsy had LGS. Although this study included a small cohort, considering that Leigh syndrome with the m.10191T>C mutation and with LGS are both the rare diseases, LGS may be frequently associated with the epilepsy phenotype in the m.10191T>C mutation. If the m.10191T>C mutation has features that are often accompanied by LGS, it may be possible to control the disease by providing intensive LGS treatment to these patients. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies support this, but we will continue to explore the relationship between LGS and the m.10191T>C mutation in future studies.\n\nHeteroplasmy is an important feature of mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome. Heteroplasmy rarely affects the type and severity of phenotypes. Within the same mutation, heteroplasmy is expected to be associated with disease severity, reflected by the specific phenotypic presentation or the time of symptom onset (4, 24). However, in this study, no correlation was identified between heteroplasmy and the onset of the first symptom or seizure. In addition, among the patients with MT-ND3 mutation, no significant difference in heteroplasmy was observed between patients with or without LGS. This may be because the total number of patients in this study was relatively small. In addition, the possibility of other factors and of heteroplasmy acting upon the onset of symptoms can also be considered. Also, although not measured in this study, heteroplasmy in brain may be different than in the blood leukocytes measured and might show a closer relationship to the neurologic presentations (7).\n\nTwo patients started the KD; one had LGS and the other had not LGS. However, both the patients discontinued the KD after 3 months due to poor oral intake and severe GI problems. This suggested possible intolerance for KDs in the patients with the m.10191T>C mutation, but a larger cohort is necessary to establish a firm conclusion. Kang et al. reported the safety and effective application of the KD in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex defects. In this study, four patients had mitochondrial disease with LGS. The KD was effective for seizure reduction in all the patients. However, the maintenance duration of the KD varied, with one patient discontinuing the KD after 3 months due to severe hypoglycemia and the other three patients maintained the KD for 6, 12, and 24 months. Two patients became seizure free (25). However, this treatment was not conducted through gene-based targeted therapy. Therefore, with the results of this study, the effect and stability of the KD may not be suitable for patients with the m.10191T>C mutation. At present, there are no studies with respect to the relationship between the KD and MT-ND3 or the m.10191T>C mutations. Genotype-based KD studies should be conducted in the future (26).\n\nValproic acid (VPA) is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug that is widely used as a first-line treatment for most types of epilepsy. In particular, patients with LGS are considered for first-line treatment (27). However, because VPA can induce mitochondrial toxicity through the inhibition and subsequent decreased activity of mitochondrial complexes I and IV, it is contraindicated for patients with a mitochondrial disease (28–30). However, in this study, VPA was used in three of the six patients with the m.10191T>C mutation and an improvement in seizure frequency was observed. Two of the three patients were diagnosed with LGS. VPA therapy may be effective in treating epilepsy depending on the clinical situation and phenotype and may not cause a contraindication. In particular, patients with the m.10191T>C mutation have mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome with a high morbidity of epilepsy that may be accompanied by refractory epilepsy such as LGS. In such situations, mitochondrial dysfunction may be diagnosed later as the etiology of epilepsy. Therefore, the careful application of VPA may assist in controlling adverse effects or mitochondrial toxicity.\n\nIn conclusion, the results of this study indicate a strong association between epilepsy and Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation, particularly the m.10191T>C mutation. Additionally, there is a possibility of an association between the epilepsy phenotype of the m.10191T>C mutation and LGS. Due to the characteristics of rare disease, there is a limitation in that this study could not be conducted on a large homogeneous patient group. Therefore, a follow-up study or meta-analysis with a large number of patients is needed in the future. This study explored the importance of specific point mutations such as the m.10191T>C mutation, although MT-ND3 mutation is important for genotype–phenotype correlation. Understanding the characteristics of Leigh syndrome with MT-ND3 mutation may assist in predicting disease progression and improving patient survival through timely treatment. This understanding could be the first step in finding biomarkers for the development of new treatments for Leigh syndrome (31).",

    "title": "Gallic Acid Derivatives Propyl Gallate and Epigallocatechin Gallate Reduce rRNA Transcription via Induction of KDM2A Activation",
    "text": "We previously reported that lysine-demethylase 2A (KDM2A), a Jumonji-C histone demethylase, is activated by gallic acid to reduce H3K36me2 levels in the rRNA gene promoter and consequently inhibit rRNA transcription and cell proliferation in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Gallic acid activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to activate KDM2A. Esters of gallic acid, propyl gallate (PG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and other chemicals, reduce cancer cell proliferation. However, whether these compounds activate KDM2A has yet to be tested. In this study, we found that PG and EGCG decreased rRNA transcription and cell proliferation through KDM2A in MCF-7 cells. The activation of both AMPK and ROS production by PG or EGCG was required to activate KDM2A. Of note, while the elevation of ROS production by PG or EGCG was limited in time, it was sufficient to activate KDM2A. Importantly, the inhibition of rRNA transcription and cell proliferation by gallic acid, PG, or EGCG was specifically observed in MCF-7 cells, whereas it was not observed in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells. Altogether, these results suggest that the derivatization of gallic acid may be used to obtain new compounds with anti-cancer activity.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nRibosomes are essential for protein synthesis; in fact, a number of ribosomes affect multiple cellular events [1,2]. Ribosome biogenesis consumes cellular resources, such as materials and energy, which are produced through nutrient metabolism [3,4]. Ribosome RNA (rRNA) transcription is an important step in ribosome construction and is a major factor controlling the number of ribosomes. The rate of rRNA transcription affects various biological events, including cancer cell proliferation [5,6]. The number and size of nucleoli, the sites of ribosome biogenesis, increase with the number of cancer cells; thus, the inhibition of rRNA transcription has been proposed as a therapeutic target to eliminate cancer cells [7].\n\nThe chemical modification of histones controls transcription [4,8]. For instance, lysine-specific histone demethylases (KDMs) are known to remove methyl groups from specific residues of histones to control the chromatin structure [9,10,11]. Of note, there are two classes of KDMs: flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amine oxidases, and Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent hydroxylases with the Jumonji-C (JmjC) domain. Defects in the enzymatic activity of KDMs are implicated in some diseases, such as developmental disorders and cancers. We previously reported that lysine-demethylase 2A (KDM2A), a JmjC-type KDM, decreases the levels of di-methylated lysine 36 in histone H3 (H3K36me2) but not the tri-methylated form (H3K36me3) in the rRNA gene promoter. KDM2A activity decreased rRNA transcription and the proliferation of breast cancer cells, such as MCF-7 cells, in response to glucose starvation, the anti-diabetic drug metformin, and the food-additive gallic acid [3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid] [6,12,13,14,15]. Under these conditions, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was activated, which was required to activate KDM2A [6,14,15]. In MCF-7 cells treated with metformin for 4 h, the intracellular levels of succinate decreased in addition to AMPK activation, both of which are required for the KDM2A activation [14]. On the other hand, although treatment with gallic acid did not lead to a decrease in the intracellular levels of succinate, it caused an elevation in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in addition to AMPK activation, both of which are required for KDM2A activation [15]. These results suggest that changes in multiple intracellular conditions, including the metabolic and redox statuses, converge to activate KDM2A and control rRNA transcription.\n\nIn a previous study, we showed that propyl gallate [propyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate] (PG) also decreases the proliferation of MCF-7 cells [15]. PG, an ester formed by the condensation of gallic acid and propanol [16], is not a natural compound; it is produced via chemical synthesis. PG is used in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries [17]. As a food additive, PG protects fats, oils, and fat-containing foods from rancidity. Importantly, PG was also reported to exhibit anti-tumor properties in HeLa cells and hepatocellular carcinoma cells [18,19]. Additionally, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of many types of cancer cells, including colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, and breast cancer cell lines. EGCG is an ester of epigallocatechin and gallic acid and a type of catechin. Importantly, this natural compound is a major active compound of green tea with proven beneficial effects on health, including antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity, and the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway [20,21,22]. It is plausible to consider that in both compounds, ester bonds are cleaved by intracellular esterases to release gallic acid, and are ultimately responsible for the above-mentioned effects. However, it is not clear whether PG and EGCG can activate KDM2A and whether there are any differences between these gallic acid derivatives and gallic acid itself.\n\nTo fill this gap in knowledge, in this study, we evaluated the impact of PG and EGCG on the activity of KDM2A in MCF-7 cells. We found that PG and EGCG decreased rRNA transcription through KDM2A in MCF-7 cells. PG and EGCG activated AMPK, and elevated ROS levels, both required for the activation of KDM2A. However, the dynamics of the ROS elevation by PG/EGCG and gallic acid were different. Importantly, we also show that in non-tumor breast epithelium MCF10A cells, PG, EGCG, and gallic acid did not reduce rRNA transcription, activate AMPK, increase ROS production, or impact cell proliferation. Overall, our results show that the gallic acid derivatives PG and EGCG activate KDM2A, consequently suggesting that the esterification of gallic acid does not impact its anti-cancer activity to a major extent.",

    "text": "Patient 1\n\nA 52-year-old man was admitted to hospital to investigate a 2-week history of worsening exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and peripheral oedema. He had multiple admissions in the previous few months due to symptomatic right-sided heart failure.\n\nBackground medical history includes extended mantle field radiotherapy for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 21 years earlier and spinal cord stimulator insertion 18 years prior for treatment of chronic back pain. He also had coronary artery disease with drug-eluting stent implantation to an ostial right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis 12 months prior and previous dual-chamber permanent pacemaker insertion due to syncope with complete heart block. Family history was unremarkable for inherited cardiomyopathies.\n\nOn examination, the jugular venous pressure (JVP) was elevated 10 cm above the sternal edge with prominent v waves. Heart sounds were dual with a soft pansystolic murmur at the left sternal edge. There was bilateral lower limb pitting oedema to his knees.\n\nResting electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm, paced rhythm (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular (LV) size and wall thickness with normal systolic function (global longitudinal strain −22%, ejection fraction 65.2%) (Video 1). The atria were normal sized and there were no significant valvular abnormalities. The pericardium appeared normal with no evidence of increased thickness. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated no evidence of restriction on spirometry. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrated no evidence of lymphoma recurrence.\n\nFigure 1. Open in a new tab A 12-lead electrocardiogram from the first day of 5-day admission demonstrating sinus rhythm with paced rhythm.\n\nRight heart catheterization revealed elevated right atrial pressures (16 mmHg), prominent y descent with mildly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and normal pulmonary artery pressures (Figure 2). Coronary angiography revealed in-stent restenosis of the ostial RCA drug-eluting stent with non-obstructive coronary artery disease in the left system (Figure 3). A high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of his chest found left deviation of the interventricular cardiac septum, suggestive of increased right heart pressures but no significant enhancement or thickening of the pericardium. Constrictive pericarditis was considered a differential diagnosis due to these haemodynamic findings. At a consequent heart team discussion, the consensus opinion was to proceed with a semi-urgent elective pericardiectomy and simultaneous bypass graft of his RCA. Our patient continued to require increasing loop diuretic titration in community follow-up for 1 month until the surgery due to worsening exertional dyspnoea.\n\nFigure 2.

Ideally, a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would have been performed to assist in confirming radiation-related myocardial changes; however, the patient had a previous lumbar stimulator insertion which is a major contraindication.\n\nPost-operatively, he was commenced on perindopril 2.5 mg, bisoprolol 2.5 mg, furosemide 40 mg twice daily, and spironolactone 25 mg once daily. At subsequent follow-up consultations with his cardiologist, there was gradual improvement in his symptoms and his neurohormonal-blockading agents and diuretics were able to be weaned. At follow-up 14 weeks after surgery, there was complete resolution of his original symptoms of exertional dyspnoea and no clinical signs of fluid overload. His weight stabilized at 83 kg, compared to 95 kg prior to the procedure.",

    "title": "Combination Therapy with CCBs and RAS Inhibitors to Counteract Endothelial Dysfunction in COVID-19",
    "text": "After the breakthrough discovery that the SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor for cellular entry, several researchers warned about the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin type II receptor blockers [ARBs]) due to their potential to enhance the expression of ACE-2, while proposing calcium channel blockers (CCBs) to replace the use of RAS inhibitors in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1]. Since then, there has been a growing interest to investigate the efficacy of CCBs in patients with COVID-19 [2].\n\nNevertheless, the recently reported randomized controlled trial by Nouri-Vakesh et al. [3] seems to hamper further investigations on the therapeutic potential of CCBs in COVID-19. The randomized trial [3], which aimed to compare the effects between losartan and amlodipine in patients with COVID-19 and primary hypertension, reported no significant difference in mortality rate, length of hospital stay, and requirement for intubation between the two treatment arms. Although with no safety concerns, the randomized trial [3] has also reported no clinical benefits with the use of CCBs or even RAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19.\n\nThe findings from the randomized trial [3] are in contrary to the observational evidence [4, 5] that the use of CCBs in patients with COVID-19 could be associated with mortality benefits. A systematic review and meta-analysis [5] of observational studies reported that the use of CCBs in patients with COVID-19 was significantly associated with lower odds of mortality (odds ratio = 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.49–0.86) and lower odds of severe disease (odds ratio = 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.44–0.84) compared with non-use of CCBs. While the calcium channels blocking effects of CCBs in the lungs and vascular system may mitigate the inflammatory effects of COVID-19, it seems that such an effect is inadequate to provide mortality benefits [2]. The same occurs with the use of RAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19, in which the observational evidence [6] reported positive effects, but the randomized trials [7] reported neutral effects.\n\nTherefore, instead of administering CCBs alone or RAS inhibitors alone to patients with COVID-19, it might be better to combine the two agents. The combination of CCBs and RAS inhibitors has synergistic effects that improve endothelial function, reduce oxidative stress, and suppress inflammatory responses, especially in the arterial vasculature [8]. Several clinical trials in patients with hypertension have demonstrated the efficacy of such combination therapy; most notably the landmark ACCOMPLISH trial [9], which randomized patients to combination therapy with benazepril plus either amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide and reported that the primary endpoint, which was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac death or coronary revascularization, achieved significantly less often in the benazepril-amlodipine group (hazard ratio: 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.72–0.90).\n\nTherefore, we believe that instead of investigating the use of CCBs alone (or RAS inhibitors alone) to patients with COVID-19, the combination therapy with CCBs and RAS inhibitors which can potentially counteract the endothelial activation and dysfunction involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis should be further investigated, preferably in randomized trials, to undertand its clinical implications in patients with COVID-19.\n\nDeclarations Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.",

    "title": "Orbital floor fractures: epidemiology and outcomes of 1594 reconstructions",
    "text": "The average patient age was 46.2 (± 20.8). Most fractures (37.5%) occurred in the age between 16 and 35. Seventy-two percent of patients were male while 28% were female. The most common cause of injury was physical assault (32.0%) followed by falls (30.8%) and traffic accidents (17.0%). The average orbital wall defect size was 297.9 mm 2 (± 190.8 mm2). For orbital floor reconstruction polydioxanone sheets (0.15 mm 38.3%, 0.25 mm 36.2%, 0.5 mm 2.8%) were mainly used, followed by titanium meshes (11.5%). Reconstructions with the 0.15 mm polydioxanone sheets showed the least complications (p < 0.01, r = 0.15). Eighteen percent of patients who showed persistent symptoms and post-operative complications: 12.9% suffered from persistent hypoesthesia, 4.4% suffered from post-operative diplopia and 3.9% showed intra-orbital hematoma.\n\nThe present literature is still divided regarding which material should preferably be used to reconstruct the orbit since no material only has advantages. Furthermore, it is unclear up to which defect size which material should be used. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze different materials i.e. PDS ® membranes (0.15 mm; 0.25 mm; 0.5 mm) and titanium meshes in a large number of patients (1594) to evaluate which material could be recommended for which defect size. A secondary goal was to analyze and discuss the existing data with regard to epidemiological aspects, surgical treatment options and postoperative complications with the current literature.\n\nThere is a still a controversy about which material is suited best for orbital floor reconstruction regarding the post-operative outcome. In 2003, Ellis and Tan were the first to show that titanium meshes are more accurate in orbital reconstruction compared to bone grafts [ 24 ]. Other retrospective studies supported their results [ 25 , 26 ]. Later Ellis and Messo estimated that titanium meshes are better suited to reconstruct the orbit compared to alloplastic materials, such as Teflon ® or PDS ® membranes, due to their incomplete degradation process which can result in sterile inflammation and development of granulomas [ 27 ]. On the other hand, it has been reported that titanium meshes cause inflammatory reactions [ 28 ] as well and are associated with significantly more post-operative complications, such as infections, extrusion and residual diplopia [ 29 ]. In 2002, Baumann et al. concluded that PDS ® membranes (0.25 mm or 0.5 mm) should only be used up to a defect size of 2.5 cm 2 because of the high risk of developing enophthalmos due to the instability of the membrane [ 30 ]. Other authors extended this indication and could show that 0.25 mm PDS ® membranes were suitable even for larger defects (median 4.32 cm 2 ) without significantly more complications, [ 20 , 31 ] Unfortunately, none of the aforementioned studies included more than 78 patients which could be a limitation to their statistical power. To our knowledge, there is only one study that included more than 500 patients [ 32 ]. In their retrospective study, Holtmann et al. found that the use of 0.15 mm PDS ® membranes resulted in the best post-operative outcome for defect sizes between 250 and 300 mm 2 [ 32 ].\n\nThere are a variety of surgical approaches to reconstruct the orbit. The infraorbital, the subcilliary and the transconjunctival incision are commonly used whereby last is often recommended in the literature [ 15 – 18 ]. For a long time, autologous bone grafts were seen as the gold standard [ 19 ] to reconstruct the orbital floor. However, the unpredictable resorption rate as well as the missing optimal volume reconstruction led to the increasing use of resorbable alloplastic biomaterials, such as poly-p-dioxanon (PDS ® ) [ 20 ] (Fig. 2 ) and polyglactin (Ethisorb ® ) [ 21 ] and non-resorbable alloplastic materials, such as the titanium mesh (Fig. 3 ), which today can be individually preformed to the patients anatomy in a CAD-CAM process [ 22 , 23 ].\n\nThe indication for a surgical intervention is controversially discussed throughout the last years. [ 11 ]. There is a general agreement that an acute loss of the visual function in the presence of a retrobulbar hematoma, severe enophthalmos, incarceration of peribulbar soft tissue and large defect sizes over 50% of the orbital floor require immediate surgical intervention to restore the anatomical structure of the orbit and improve the visual function as well as the orbital appearance [ 12 – 14 ].\n\nCoronal and sagittal CT slice of an isolated orbital floor fracture with a prolapse and incarceration of surrounding soft tissue. The size of the orbital floor defect was calculated by measuring the widest range of the defect in the coronal slices of the CT scans multiplied with the number of slices in which the defect was still visible and the layer thickness of the coronal slices\n\nEpidemiological studies involving 600 hospitals in Germany from the TraumaNetzwerk DGU ® reported from a pooled number of patients of 102,887, that 11,451 (11.1%) suffered from facial trauma [ 1 ]. The orbit is especially susceptible to injury because of its very complex anatomical structure with hard and soft tissue. Blunt trauma in this facial region may cause an isolated orbital “blowout” fracture or a combined orbital fracture and midface fracture [ 2 ]. Today, there are a variety of classifications for midface fractures which include fractures of the orbit [ 3 – 5 ]. However, only the recently introduced AO classification for facial fractures permits a very precise description of the orbital injury pattern [ 5 ]. Depending on the type of fracture, patients can suffer from a variety of complications. Incarceration of the surrounding soft tissue (Fig. 1 ) can result in limitations of ocular movement [ 6 ], Diplopia [ 7 ] or enophthalmos. Another frequent complication is the irritation of the infraorbital nerve which runs in close proximity of the orbit and can result in temporary or permanent infraorbital hypoesthesia [ 8 ]. Furthermore, a retrobulbar hematoma can lead to a reduced or total loss of vision [ 9 ]. In addition to the clinical parameters, the computer tomography (Fig. 1 ) presents the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis [ 10 ].\n\nPatient data were anonymized and transferred into Microsoft Excel ® (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond WA, USA, Version 16.35 for Mac). Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism 8 for Mac, Version 8.4.2 (San Diego CA, USA). A statistically significant correlation between the collected parameters was tested using simple linear regression. Effect sizes were calculated according to Cohen [ 33 ]. An r value of < 0.10 was regarded as weak, < 0.30 as intermediate and > 0.50 as strong effect. Data collection and statistical analysis were carried out by one of the authors of this study.\n\nThe size of the orbital floor defect was calculated according to Ellis and Ten [ 24 ] by measuring the widest range of the defect in the coronal slices of the CT scans multiplied with the number of slices in which the defect was still visible and the layer thickness of the coronal slices (Fig. 2 ).\n\nA retrospective study with a collective of 1874 patients with isolated or combined orbital fractures that were treated at the Department of Oral, Cranio-Maxillofacial and Facial Plastic Surgery, University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany in the years between 2007 and 2017 was conducted. Patients were diagnosed after clinical examination and radiological evaluation. Two hundred eighty (280) patients which were treated conservatively were excluded from the study, which resulted in 1594 included patients. Data was extracted from the internal patient management program “Orbis” from Agfa ® HealthCare GmbH (Bonn, Germany) and included pre- and post-operative radiological data, surgical documentation, follow-up clinical documentation, pre- and post-operative ophthalmological consultations. Target parameters included patient age and gender, time and causation of the accident, pre-operative clinical symptoms, such as hypoesthesia or diplopia, time between accident and treatment, type of fracture (isolated vs. combined), defect size, type of surgical incision, type of reconstruction material (0.15 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.5 mm polydioxanone sheets or titanium mesh) and the number of pre-, peri- and post-operative complications, such as retrobulbar hematoma, diplopia, hypoesthesia, visual impairment, displacement of the reconstruction material, infections and others. Typically, patients were followed up in the first four weeks after discharge and finally three months after discharge.\n\nIn total, 18% (n = 296) of patients presented post-operative complications (Table 1 ). Most frequently patients presented post-operative hypesthesia (12.9%, n = 206), diplopia (4.1%, n = 66), followed by intra-orbital hematoma (4.0%, n = 62) and displacement of the used reconstruction material (2.1%, n = 34). Twenty-five patients with intra-orbital hematomas required drainage and underwent a second operation. Furthermore, twenty patients (1.2%) presented an exophthalmos and eleven patients (0.6%) presented a permanently reduced eyesight after surgery. With increasing defect size, a post-operative complication was more likely (p < 0.001; r = 0.1703; n = 1187). The infra-orbital incision showed a higher risk of post-operative complications (p = 0.002; r = 0.0761; n = 305), such as reduced vision (p = 0.028; r = 0.05511; n = 305) and retrobulbar hematoma (p = 0.009; r = 0.06531; n = 305). Moreover, thirty-six patients (2.2%) developed other post-operative complications that were not directly related to the surgery, such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia or hypertensive crisis.\n\nIn 38.3% (n = 611), the 0.15 mm PDS ® membrane was used to reconstruct the orbital floor defects, followed by the 0.25 mm PDS ® membrane (36.2%, n = 577) and the titanium mesh (11.5%, n = 184). The 0.5 mm PDS ® membrane was only used in forty-five patients (2.8%). In 2.6% (n = 41) a combination of titanium mesh and PDS ® membrane was used. In 5.1% of cases, no data were recorded because of missing documentation. On average, the 0.15 mm PDS ® membrane was used for a mean defect size of 225.17 mm 2 (min = 31.5 mm 2 , max = 750.0, SD = 151.5 mm 2 ), the 0.25 mm PDS ® membrane for 278.5 mm 2 (min = 44.6 mm 2 , max = 1019.0 mm 2 , SD = 157.6 mm 2 ) and the 0.5 mm PDS ® membrane for 282.0 mm 2 (min = 68.3 mm 2 , max = 750.0 mm 2 , SD = 182.2 mm 2 ). The average defect size for a titanium mesh was 455.2 mm 2 (min = 64.7 mm 2 , max = 1371.2 mm 2 , SD = 196.0 mm 2 ). The use of the 0.15 mm PDS ® membrane correlated with significantly less postoperative complications (p < 0.001; r = 0.1932; n = 1492), in contrast, the use of a titanium mesh correlated with more postoperative complications (p < 0.001; r = 0.1763; n = 1492). With increasing defect size, the use of the 0.25 mm PDS ® membrane and the titanium mesh increased (p < 0.001; r = 0.4015; n = 1135).\n\nThe trans-conjunctival incision was (83%, n = 1323) the most commonly used approach to the orbit, followed by the infra-orbital incision (5.5%, n = 83), which was mainly used in more severe cases and the medial eyebrow incision (5%, n = 79). In twenty-nine patients (1.8%), an already existing wound was used for an incision. In 43 patients (2.7%), it was not possible to determine which type of incision had been selected due to a lack of data. The infra-orbital approach was significantly chosen more often with increasing patient age (p ≤ 0.001; r = 0.1698; n = 1551).\n\nSixty-two percent (n = 987) of patients presented orbital fractures combined with other facial fractures while 38% (n = 601) presented isolated orbital fractures. In six cases, it was not possible to collect data due to a lack of documentation. Positive correlations between the occurrence of combined fractures and traffic accidents as a cause of injury (p ≤ 0.001; r = 0.1914; n = 1486) as well as with male gender (p = 0.018; r = 0.05948; n = 1486) could be observed. In 40% (n = 630) of fractures a prolapse of orbital soft tissue occurred. The possibility of a prolapse and entrapment of soft tissue increased with the occurrence of a combined fracture (p ≤ 0.001; r = 0.32; n = 1495). The average defect size was 297.8 mm 2 (SD = 190.8 mm 2 , min = 5.47mm 2 , max = 1500mm 2 ). The prolapse of soft tissue occurred more frequently as the defect size increased (p ≤ 0.001; r = 0.1642; n = 1123) and showed a positive correlation with the period between the accident event and the operation (p = 0.026; r = 0.06613; n = 1135).\n\nIn 74.2% (n = 1182) of patients, no preoperative symptoms (excluding pain) were recorded. Most often hypoesthesia was described by 13% (n = 208) of patients, followed by diplopia (7%, n = 112), anisocoria (2.3%, n = 36) and visual impairment of the affected eye (1.2%, n = 19). Eleven patients were admitted to the clinic with a retrobulbar hematoma (0.7%, n = 11) and six patients (0.4%) presented an exophthalmos. Combined fractures patients correlated positively with the occurrence of preoperative symptoms (p = 0.003; r = 0.13; n = 416) and patients that had symptoms prior to surgery also were more likely to have postoperative complications (p = 0.011; r = 0.29; n = 75).\n\nOverall, 1594 patients that were surgically treated because of an isolated or combined orbital fracture in the years between 2007 and 2017 were included in the study. Patients median age was 42.5 years (SD = 20.8 years), 37.5% of patients were in the age between 15 and 35 years. Younger patient age correlated positively with smaller defect sizes (p ≤ 0.001; r = 0.106; n = 1198). Four-hundred-forty-four patients were female (28%) while 1150 patients were male (72%). There was a positive correlation between the male gender (p ≤ 0.001; r = 0.34; n = 1594) and a younger patient age (p ≤ 0.001; r = 0.34; n = 1594) and physical assault as the cause of injury. Older patient age strongly correlated with accident or falls as the cause of injury (p ≤ 0.001; r = 0.58; n = 1594). The most common causes of injury were physical assault (32.0%, n = 511), followed by falls (30.8%, n = 491), traffic accidents (17.0%, n = 272), sport injuries (6.5%, n = 104), injuries during work (5.3%, n = 85) and polytrauma (1.8%, n = 29).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis retrospective study was conducted on 1594 patients who had been operatively treated for orbital floor fractures between 2007 and 2017 at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial and facial plastic Surgery of the Goethe University Hospital in Frankfurt (Germany). The primary goal of this study was to evaluate which reconstruction material would be best suited for which type and size of orbital floor fracture. A secondary goal was to analyze and discuss the existing data with regard to epidemiological aspects, surgical treatment options and postoperative complications with the current literature.\n\nIn the course of the demographic change in most western societies and the increasing number of multimorbid patients, a rigorous patient selection and indication for surgical treatment become more important. Factors, such as age and diabetes mellitus [34, 35], cardio-pulmonary disease [36] and anti-coagulant medication, can significantly increase the risk of post-operative complications and nosocomial infections [37]. In our patient collectively, thirty-six patients (2.2%) developed post-operative symptoms associated with urinary tract infections, pneumonia or hypertension. More than halve of these patients were older than 75 years. Moreover, the risk of domestic falls increases with age [38] which is reflected by the data of our study. Twenty-three percent of our patients were older than 65 years and with patient age the average size of the defect also significantly increased, which could be related to loss of bone elasticity with increasing age. Interestingly, no significant correlation could be found between patient age and post-operative complications in our study which can be an indication for a good patient selection for surgical treatment especially in elder people.\n\nGenerally orbital floor fractures can be treated conservatively or operatively. The indication for the latter is still being debated in the present literature. However, it is undisputed that certain symptoms, such as an enophtalmus > 2 mm, a defect size > 1 cm2, a severe dislocation of fragments, a limited motility of the bulb with double vision or a prolapse and incarceration of orbital soft tissue must be treated operatively [39–42]. The defect size (> 1 cm2) is most often used as an indication for surgery. In our patient collective only fifty-four (3.4%) presented defect sizes < 1 cm2 which corresponds to the current recommendations.\n\nThe ideal time of surgical intervention is still being debated in the present literature. Burnstine et al. distinguished between an intermediate intervention which should be carried out in case of an early enophthalmos with facial asymmetry with signs of a bulbo-cardial reflex or decreased vision of the affected eye and an early intervention within the first 14 days which should be carried out in case of significant lowering of the affected eye, hypoesthesia of the infraorbital nerve, defect sizes > 1 cm2 and double-vision with radiological signs of soft tissue incarceration [43]. This recommendation is also reflected in the present guidelines of the German Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery [44]. Early intervention is recommended by most authors since it is associated with significantly less post-operative complications, such as diplopia or enophthalmos [42, 44–48]. Nevertheless, the decline of soft tissue swelling which usually takes place within five to seven days should be awaited. In the present study, the average time between trauma and operation was 6.46 days (SD = 11). Interestingly, we could observe a significant correlation between the time between trauma and operation and post-operative complications which support the current literature and guidelines that recommend an early intervention. A possible explanation for this correlation could be, that older patients in our cohort were operated significantly later after trauma due to co-morbidities and these patients also had significantly bigger defect sizes, which can result in more post-operative complications.\n\nThe vast majority (77.5%, n = 1236) of our patients was treated with PDS® membranes (0.15 mm; n = 614; 0.25 mm; n = 577; 0.5 mm; n = 45). Hiding et al. were the first to postulate certain requirements for the ideal reconstruction material like easy handling, good plasticity, natural resorption and sufficient stability and found that PDS® membranes meet most of these criteria. They also found that the degradation of PDS® membranes is associated with an inflammatory reaction and the development a scar tissue that stabilizes the defect after complete resorption within six months [49]. Most authors recommend the use of a PDS membrane only up to a defect size of 200 mm2 and argue that the scar tissue could be insufficient in stabilizing bigger defects which could result in more post-operative complications [30, 39]. In our study, the average defect sizes for 0.15 mm and 0.25 mm PDS membranes were 225,17 mm2 and 278.5 mm2, respectively, which surpasses the general recommendations. The biggest defect that was treated with a 0.25 mm PDS membrane measured more than 1019 mm2 and 750 mm2 for a 0.5 mm PDS membrane. However, none of those patients presented post-operative complications. Since the reconstruction with the 0.15 mm membrane was associated with significantly less post-operative complications (p ≤ 0.001; r = 0.1932; n = 1492) it can be recommended as alternative for orbital floor defects beyond the 2 cm2 which can be found in the current literature.\n\nFor bigger (> 300 mm2) or instable fractures that include the medial or lateral orbital wall, titanium meshes are generally recommended in the literature [24, 42, 50]. Their rigidity makes them ideal for more complex fractures, and today, pre-bent or CAD-CAM individualized titanium meshes are easy to insert [51]. In our study, 184 patients (11%) were reconstructed using a titanium mesh. Ellis and Tan were the first to show that titanium meshes are an accurate material for orbital reconstruction compared to bone grafts and present a high bio-compatibility to bone tissue [24]. However, there are studies and case reports that associate titanium with hyper sensory and even allergic reactions [52]. Sugar et al. (1992) listed foreign body reactions, complications when inserting or explanting and frequent infections as some of the disadvantages of titanium meshes. We also could observe significantly more post-operative complications in patients that were treated with a titanium mesh compared to the patients that were reconstructed using a PDS® membrane. However, it has to be taken into account that titanium meshes were more often used for bigger and instable fractures (median 421.6 mm2) and defect size significantly correlated with post-operative complications. Although not implemented in our patients collective, an additional alloplastic implant that requires consideration for the treatment of large defects, is porous high-density polyethylene (Medpor) [53]. However, this material has also been associated to complications [54]. Randomized and controlled studies that investigate the use of different reconstruction materials for equal size defects are needed, to investigate whether complications are related to the reconstruction material or to the size of the defect alone.\n\nThe surgical incision should allow a sufficient overview of the operation area without leaving functional and esthetic impairment [42]. The trans-conjunctival incision was by far (83%, n = 1323) the most commonly used approach to the orbit in the present study. Critics of this approach say that it is associated with a reduced overview of the operation area and that it leads to more complications, such as lower eye lid ulceration, entropium and epiphora [55]. In the present study, the complication rate associated with the trans-conjunctival approach was 0.4% and therefore regarded as very low, which is in line with previous studies that also found low complications rates and recommend this approach especially for younger patients because of the ideal esthetic results [56, 57]. However, it should be noted that complications, such as entropium and epiphora, must be regarded as long-term complications and therefore might not be detected because of the three-month clinical follow-up. The infra-orbital incision was rarely used (5.5%, n = 83) in the present study because of the visible post-operative scar even though there are studies that report an equal esthetic outcome of the this approach compared to the transconjunctival approach [55]. However, the infra-orbital incision showed a significantly higher risk of post-operative complications, even though the effect was rather weak, so that we would recommend this approach only for emergency treatment where a wide overview of the operation area has to established in short time.\n\nIn the present study, a complication rate of 18% was found. In the literature, an interval of complication rates between 1.8% and 44% is given [14, 58–60]. Consequently, a comparatively low rate could be observed in the present study. Moreover, the definition of a post-operative complication in the literature differ widely from severe complications, such as a retrobulbar hematoma to frequent complications, such as post-operative hypesthesia, which explains the wide the range of complication rates published. In this study, the occurrence of post-operative hypesthesia was the most common postoperative complication with 206 cases (12.9%) which is comparatively low to the incidence that is reported in the literature with an interval between 5 and 33% [47, 50]. It should be mentioned that the hypoesthesia specified here was observed and documented during the clinical follow-up within three months. In the literature, depending on the injury pattern, regeneration of neural tissue is generally only expected after 2 weeks to 6 months [61] which permits the assumption that some of these cases a restitutio ad integrum could be expected.\n\nWithin the patient collective, a prolapse of the peribulbar soft tissue into the maxillary sinus was observed in 40% of the cases (n = 630). On the one hand, this can indicate a “blow-out” fracture in which the volume of the orbital funnel is increased. On the other hand, a prolapse, which is shown as a “hanging drop” in the CT scan, can also be caused by an incarceration of fat or muscle tissue. Independent of the mechanisms, the results show that enophthalmos can appear until days or weeks after the accident or treatment. This is because swelling or a developed hematoma can hide a decrease in volume of the orbital funnel.\n\nIn this study, too, corresponding to existing results, a preoperative retro- or infraorbital hematoma in 11 cases (0.7%) and an exophthalmos in six cases (0.4%) could be observed, which are rare spontaneous symptoms after trauma. All six patients with an exophthalmos reported reduced or lost visual acuity. These were due to an increase in pressure of the orbit. The symptom of a retro- / infraorbital hematoma with the formation of an exophthalmos as well as an accompanying change in visual acuity is an emergency indication for lateral canthotomy. Each of these patients was therefore treated with this procedure according to lege artis.\n\nIn six cases (9.5%), this corresponds to 0.4% in the entire group, the revision was due to a postoperative visual impairment or visual acuity loss. Permanent blindness was observed in one case. However, this was due to a direct trauma to the bulb and consecutively the visual nerve and not related to the performed surgery. This corresponds to a share of 0.06% in the entire patient collective. In the literature, the postoperative complication of blindness is not consistently stated; a complication rate of 0.04 to 8.3% is reported. [62–64]\n\nThe data analysis showed that a revision, which was indicated due to an incorrect reconstruction, occurred significantly more frequently with increasing defect size (p = 0.003). In these cases, it could often be determined on the basis of the operation report that the reconstruction of the orbital floor or the insertion of the implant was problematic. Day et al. showed in 2018 that with the help of custom-made titanium mesh, a reduction in complication rates is possible, also with regard to position correction [65]. In the present study, too, an individual CAD/CAM technology-supported production of a titanium mesh was implanted in one patient. The defect was measured with a size of 260.83 mm2 and its extent was mainly posterior. However, due to the limitation of the results from one individual case, a general recommendation cannot be made.\n\nWithin our data analysis, a correlation between the preoperative and postoperative diplopia was observed. Orbital fractures can be regarded as one of several conditions in the development of a diplopia [55]. Therefore, the probability of double-image perception occurring increases with increasing defect size [48]. On the other hand, a significant correlation between the presence of preoperative symptoms of diplopia and the postoperative occurrence of double vision (p = 0.012) could be found. Ramphul and Hoffmann published a review in 2017 in which they examined the same relationship. As a result, they stated that no significance could be determined between the pre- and post-operative occurrences of diplopia. Due to the different etiologies of diplopia, in their opinion, different courses are possible. In this way, a diplopia can be completely eliminated, reduced, intensified or induced by the operation, whereby a statistical normal distribution is generated [66].\n\nA remaining limitation of this study is the retrospective, mono centric design of the study, which may restrict the interpretation of the data. However, this disadvantage is compensated by the highest number of patients with orbital floor fractures evaluated in the literature so far.",

    "text": "From labs to jabs The journey of COVID-19 vaccines from creation to inoculation\n\nThe frontrunners in the global COVID-19 vaccine race have emerged and the first injections have been administered in Britain, the United States and elsewhere. But the route to distribute these much-anticipated vaccines across the world will be a challenge that will require deep freezes, careful timing, planes, trains, trucks and maybe even some intrepid donkeys. Below is a look at the journeys of three leading experimental vaccines that have been effective in preventing infections of the novel coronavirus in late-stage trials. The first is from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE , the second is from Moderna Inc with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the third is from AstraZeneca and Oxford University .\n\nPfizer-BioNTech Moderna AstraZeneca Source of the vaccine Some vaccines are gambling on promising technologies, while others are relying on approaches that have proven successful in the past. New mRNA technology Both of these vaccines use a chemical messenger to instruct the body’s cells to make proteins similar to the spike proteins on the new coronavirus. Modified carrier virus A weakened chimpanzee cold virus has been altered to include the genetic sequence of the coronavirus spike proteins. Vials Critical to the effective storage of temperature-sensitive vaccines, vials can render medicines unusable if damaged. Moderna vaccine 10 doses in a vial and each person will need 2 doses given 28 days apart. AstraZeneca vaccine 8-10 doses in a vial and each person will need 2 doses given 28 days apart. Pfizer vaccine 5 doses in a vial and each person will need 2 doses given 21 days apart. Cold chain The process of distribution and storage at cold temperatures to keep vaccines stable.

GPS enabled temperature trackers help monitor vaccine stability. Container with dry ice sits above the vaccines. Each tray can fit 195 vials. 1 to 5 trays fit in the inner payload carton and once closed, dry ice fills the sides and spaces. Medium thermal shipper is about the size of a carry-on suitcase. Production Within the company Pfizer and BioNTech plan to make raw materials and produce the vaccine themselves.

Airlines are now considering options ranging from a large plug-in freezer, which can cost about as much as a small car, to a multi-layered canister that uses liquid nitrogen to ship vaccines requiring a deep freeze. Some trucks will be packed with dry ice and others will be refrigerated. Some will have no temperature controls and will rely solely on the cooling stability of the vaccine transport coolers. Unlike Pfizer’s vaccine which needs to be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines do not require specialized ultra-cold freezers or vast quantities of dry ice, making it easier to supply rural and remote areas. UNICEF is working with manufacturers and other partners to procure COVID-19 vaccines for poorer countries, as well as help them with freight, logistics and storage. The U.N. children’s agency, which has experience delivering medicines to all corners of the world, calls the “cold chain” a complex undertaking that requires precise coordination in temperature-controlled environments to prevent a vaccine from losing its potency. “From storage facilities down to the village level, health workers carry vaccines in cold boxes and vaccine carriers, traveling by car, motorcycle, bicycle, donkey, camel or on foot to immunize every last child, even in the most remote of villages,”, UNICEF said on its website.\n\nAwaiting vaccination As vaccines travel from the manufacturer to the clinics, shipments will cross time zones and different environments. But the integrity of the vaccine relies on stable, consistent temperatures. If the correct cold chain temperatures are maintained, all three vaccines will have a shelf life of about six months. But vaccines are sensitive to temperature variations and once stability is compromised, it cannot be recovered. Temperatures should be monitored throughout the vaccine’s shelf life. Vaccines can be removed from their long-term, temperature-controlled environments anytime before the six-month expiry date. But once refrigerated or in room temperature, the time of stability becomes shorter.\n\n°C °F 40 100 Body temperature Vaccines stored at 5°C AstraZeneca Out of storage 2 to 8°C for at least 6 months AstraZeneca vaccine can be administered in existing healthcare settings — stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions. 2 to 8°C 32°F 0°C 6 hours at room temperature After first opening the vial, the AstraZeneca vaccine should be used within 6 hours. After dilution, the Pfizer vaccine should be used immediately and within 6 hours. 2-8°C for 5 days Once out of the thermal shippers, Pfizer doses can be refrigerated. 2° to 8°C for up to 30 days Moderna vaccine can be refrigerated for a month within the six-month shelf life. Vaccines often need to be transported long distances, while maintaining stable temperatures along every step of the way. Frozen desserts -20°C Moderna Up to 6 months at -20°C For shipping and long-term storage, Moderna expects the vaccine will be stable in most home or medical freezer temperatures. -20°C ± 5°C 12 hours at room temperature Once the first dose has been taken, the other doses in the vial should be administered within 6 hours. -40°F -40°C -70°C for up to 10 days Pfizer thermal shippers stabilise ultra cold temperatures with dry ice. After 10 days, the shippers need to be refilled with 23kg of dry ice and then refilled again every 5 days. After 15 additional days Pfizer doses need to be removed from the thermal shippers and either stored short term in medical refrigerators or long term in ultra-low freezers. Up to 6 months at -70°C Stored in ultra-low-temperature freezers, which are commercially available and can extend the shelf life of the Pfizer vaccine.

The AstraZeneca vaccine can be administered straight from the vial. The Moderna dose needs a gentle swirl after the vial is thawed. And the Pfizer vaccine, fresh out of a deep freeze, will require dilution and repeated inversion, but do not shake. The attention and consideration necessary for the Pfizer vaccine could require specialist skills that may not be available in all corners of the globe. Timings and protocol will need to be followed closely.\n\nStorage at vaccination facilities Established cold chain Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines can be stored in existing medical freezers and refrigerators. Specialist storage Stability of the Pfizer vaccine requires specialist ultra-cold freezers and storage. Vaccination prep Frozen vaccines must be thawed and brought up to room temperature before being used. The vials should be inspected for any discolouration or visible particles. Onsite work Once thawed, the Pfizer vaccine must be diluted with a saline solution in the vial and be gently inverted 10 times. Ready to go from the vial Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines do not require onsite dilution or special handling. Injection Syringes and needles of appropriate gauge and length are required for people of different age, gender and weight.

In the real world, there are multiple, unpredictable factors, including how many, or few, people adhere to the optimum dosing schedule and timetable; how individuals’ immune systems respond; whether the vaccine was stored at the correct temperature; whether people know, or don’t know, if they have been exposed before. It is also not known how long a vaccine will protect someone from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin has said he is optimistic the immunization effect of the vaccine would last for a year.Experts say that it is likely we will have to live alongside the virus. The evidence suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNtech , Moderna and AstraZeneca will help stop people developing the disease. Only AstraZeneca’s data, so far, shows signs that its vaccine may also help prevent transmission of the virus.",

    "text": "VACCINE ROLLOUT One in a million? Comparing the side effects and potential risks of the COVID-19 vaccines\n\nU.S. federal health agencies have recommended pausing the use of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine after six recipients developed a rare disorder involving blood clots, in a fresh setback to global efforts to tackle the pandemic. The move comes a week after European regulators said they had found a possible link between AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine and a rare blood clotting problem that had led to a small number of deaths. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said one person had died from the rare blood clotting condition after taking the single-dose J&J vaccine and another was in a critical condition. Immunology experts stressed the risk posed by the vaccine appeared extremely low, but they acknowledged the need for health officials to proceed with caution to understand the best ways to mitigate any risk.\n\nIn general, common side effects from vaccines include those that affect the injection area, such as pain, redness or swelling, and those that affect the rest of the body, like fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever or nausea. These are usually normal signs that the vaccine is working as the body is building protection.\n\nMORE COMMON EFFECTS Less than 1 in 10 people More than 1 in 10 people Swelling and redness at the injection site, nausea Pain at injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever Pfizer-BioNTech Rash, redness or hives at the injection site Pain or swelling at the injection site, tenderness and swelling of the underarm glands, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches, stiffness, fatigue, chills, fever Moderna Swelling, redness or a lump at the injection site, fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, flu-like symptoms Tenderness, pain, warmth, itching or bruising where the injection is given, fatigue, chills or feeling feverish, headache, nausea, joint pain or muscle ache Astrazeneca Pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle ache, nausea Johnson & Johnson Fever, redness and swelling at the injection site Source: U.S. Food and Drug Administration; U.K. Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; REUTERS MORE COMMON EFFECTS Less than 1 in 10 people More than 1 in 10 people Swelling and redness at the injection site, nausea Pain at injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever Pfizer-BioNTech Rash, redness or hives at the injection site Pain or swelling at the injection site, tenderness and swelling of the underarm glands, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches, stiffness, fatigue, chills, fever Moderna Tenderness, pain, warmth, itching or bruising where the injection is given, fatigue, chills or feeling feverish, headache, nausea, joint pain or muscle ache Swelling, redness or a lump at the injection site, fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, flu-like symptoms Astrazeneca Johnson & Johnson Pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle ache, nausea Fever, redness and swelling at the injection site Source: U.S. Food and Drug Administration; U.K. Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; REUTERS MORE COMMON EFFECTS Less than 1 in 10 people More than 1 in 10 people Swelling and redness at the injection site, nausea Pain at injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever Pfizer-BioNTech Rash, redness or hives at the injection site Pain or swelling at the injection site, tenderness and swelling of the underarm glands, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches, stiffness, fatigue, chills, fever Moderna Tenderness, pain, warmth, itching or bruising where the injection is given, fatigue, chills or feeling feverish, headache, nausea, joint pain or muscle ache Swelling, redness or a lump at the injection site, fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, flu-like symptoms Astrazeneca Johnson & Johnson Pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle ache, nausea Fever, redness and swelling at the injection site Source: U.S. Food and Drug Administration; U.K. Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; REUTERS MORE COMMON EFFECTS Less than 1 in 10 people More than 1 in 10 people Pfizer-BioNTech Pain at injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever Swelling and redness at the injection site, nausea Moderna Rash, redness or hives at the injection site Pain or swelling at the injection site, tenderness and swelling of the underarm glands, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches, stiffness, fatigue, chills, fever Astrazeneca Swelling, redness or a lump at the injection site, fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, flu-like symptoms Tenderness, pain, warmth, itching or bruising where the injection is given, fatigue, chills or feeling feverish, headache, nausea, joint pain or muscle ache Johnson & Johnson Pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle ache, nausea Fever, redness and swelling at the injection site Source: U.S. Food and Drug Administration; U.K. Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; REUTERS\n\nIn the six J&J cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia). The recipients were women between the ages of 18 and 48, and the symptoms occurred six to 13 days after vaccination. J&J said it was delaying the rollout of the vaccine to Europe and it was working closely with regulators. The company noted that no clear causal relationship had been established between the events and the vaccine made by its Janssen unit.\n\nAs of April 12, more than 6.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine had been administered in the United States, compared with more than 180 million shots combined of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. Europe’s drugs regulator continues to recommend the use of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, saying the benefits outweigh the risks. Several EU countries, however, have limited its use to certain age groups.\n\nNumber of serious disorders registered in Europe ASTRAZENECA JOHNSON&JOHNSON MODERNA PFIZER - BIONTECH 289 2,764 3,110 Blood and lymphatic disorders 938 4,261 4,721 Cardiac disorders 1,627 11,083 33,965 Gastrointestinal disorders 3,210 20,627 63,671 Nervous system disorders 1,537 7,647 10,658 Respiratory system disorders Note: Data as of April 12.

More research is needed to determine whether there is a link between those conditions and the vaccines – experts say the number of cases seen so far could be in line with background rates in the general population with or without vaccination. “Even if all of the cases were caused by the vaccine, the risk of less than one in a million would have to be set against the benefits of protection from COVID-19 disease; a disease which, in itself, causes clotting in many cases,” said Peter English, a retired consultant in communicable disease control and a vaccine expert.\n\nSOME SYMPTOMS REPORTED AFTER VACCINATIONS AstraZeneca Johnson & Johnson Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna 1.9 cases per million 1.1 cases per million 6 cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among 6.8 million people vaccinated in the U.S. 32 cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among 17 million people vaccinated in Europe and the UK.

    "title": "Tracking the vaccine race",
    "text": "The race to create vaccines against the novel coronavirus is entering a critical stretch, with several candidates that were first out of the gate beginning to release late-stage trial data and possibly seeking early regulatory approval . Multiple “winners” are likely to make it to market, and success will depend on a number of factors reflected in this tracker.\n\nTrack record Vaccines that don’t demonstrate overall safety in small phase 1 and 2 trials will not go any further. Some of the leading coronavirus candidates have the advantage of being based on familiar, time-tested formulas, including candidates containing a viral protein or inactivated whole virus, with or without an immune-boosting adjuvant. Other contenders represent newer technologies, including those based on RNA, DNA or virus-like particles, but even some of these approaches have already led to licensed vaccines against other diseases or at least gone through prior human trials. And they have a few advantages of their own, such as fast manufacture or smaller dose requirements. Viral vectors are both old and new, having been long in development for other applications and already used in some licensed vaccines. This design reliably provokes an immune response, but the vaccines may also share a potential problem: the harmless viruses that serve as a “vector” to ferry genetic instructions into cells may already be recognized by the human immune system, which can reduce vaccine effectiveness and require higher dosages. Another worry is that a first vaccine shot could create immunity to the vector that weakens the effect of a second shot. For vaccine designers, “it is a risk to be mitigated,” Nathalie Garçon, CEO and CSO of BIOASTER and former chief of GSK Biologicals’ Global Adjuvant Center for Vaccines told Reuters. Large-scale trials will reveal if the risk is serious and if vaccine designers can find a way around it.\n\nVaccine timeline Vaccine development normally takes years, starting with preclinical laboratory work. But most pandemic vaccines are being tested in overlapping trial phases to compress the timeline. In Phases 1 and 2, safety and early immune responses are assessed. In Phase 3, researchers will also look at vaccine efficacy: does it protect, who does it protect, and how well? Regulators will use that data in approval decisions. A handful of vaccines are in production already, so as to be ready for rapid distribution when approved. Clinical trials pre-clinical Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 approval production Clinical trials pre-clinical Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 approval production Clinical trials approval production Phase 1 pre-clinical Phase 2 Phase 3 Regulators aprove Animal trial Safety trial Large group trial Efficacy trial Clinical trials pre-clinical Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 approval production Safety trial Large group trial Efficacy trial Regulators aprove Animal trial\n\nTrial results Whether a pandemic vaccine requires one dose or two, and how far apart shots must be given, can impact how practical it will be to distribute and how much it costs. Phase 3 trials–which typically include tens of thousands of volunteers with a greater diversity of backgrounds and a wider age range than early safety trials–will also reveal a vaccine’s efficacy: how much of the population it is likely to protect, and to what degree. The race for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is challenging the vaccine industry at every level, Garçon said. Vaccine designers are not only trying to make a single vaccine meant to protect 2 billion people or more, they’ve been doing it without knowing what immune responses equate with protection against this new virus. As a proxy, many compared responses in early trial volunteers to those seen in recovered COVID-19 patients. In phase 3, researchers can begin to see who resists infection in the real world. Experts project the leading candidates might protect roughly 70% of vaccinated people against infection or against severe COVID-19 if they are infected. The U.S. FDA has set a minimum threshold of 50% efficacy to even consider a vaccine for approval. Still not clear is how long that protection will last, but it could be as little as a year, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said last June and BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin echoed in November. Advance orders All the unknowns have not stopped governments and international organizations, including the WHO through its COVAX initiative, from pouring funding into a handful of candidates to speed their development and regulatory review. A fierce international competition to lock in billions of dollars’ worth of purchase commitments has also been underway for months, and some companies will soon start delivering millions of doses.\n\nInitial doses ordered by country Per 100 people Total Other vaccines Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech/AstraZeneca-Oxford\n\n* Italy, Germany, Netherlands and France Note: Graphic includes initial doses ordered. Some deals provide for subsequent dose orders, but these are not shown. Some vaccines require two doses. Some countries have announced deals, but do not specify amounts including Canada, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Qatar, Thailand and the EU.\n\nNow, the vaccine candidates must prove themselves. We’re tracking the candidates closest to producing results and a few that represent promising new technologies to watch.\n\nVaccine details Information about individual vaccine candidates' technology and latest reported results.",

    "title": "Canadian truckers protest vaccine mandates by blocking bridges",
    "text": "Protests against COVID-19 vaccine mandates for U.S.-Canada cross-border truckers have become a rallying point against public health measures, disrupted trade and begun to spread globally.\n\nHorn-blaring demonstrations demanding an end to Canadian COVID-19 vaccine mandates for cross-border truck drivers have caused gridlock in the capital Ottawa since late January.\n\nOver the last two weeks, the demonstrations have morphed into a wider protest against COVID restrictions and the Canadian government. They have spread globally , with copycat protests springing up in Australia, New Zealand and France , while truckers in the United States have said they are planning similar demonstrations.\n\nThe White House warned on Feb. 9 that protesters blocking the border crossings risk hurting the auto industry.\n\nCanada sends 75% of its goods exports to the United States. The Ambassador Bridge, a key supply route for the U.S. auto industry in Detroit, has been shut for inbound Canada traffic since the night of Feb. 7. The bridge usually handles 8,000 trucks a day, representing a quarter of all cross-border trade, or about C$500 million ($393.6 million) per day.\n\nAt Coutts, Alberta, protesters have disrupted cross-border traffic for more than a week. The Coutts crossing sees C$44 million per day in two-way trade, said David MacLean, vice-president of the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters.\n\nThe protests were disrupting jobs and the economy's supply chain and \"must end before further damage occurs,\" Canada's Emergency Preparedness Minister, Bill Blair, told reporters in a press briefing.",

    "text": "What you need to know\n\nReuters has launched a global effort to track the vaccine rollout plans of over 80 countries and all 50 U.S. states. Our journalists are collecting, verifying and updating information on vaccine availability and eligibility as the plans are announced and implemented by governments and health authorities around the world.\n\nReuters is also analysing how quickly countries are vaccinating their populations, using data collected from over 130 countries by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination data can be reported by countries as the total number of doses administered and/or the number of people vaccinated. Because most coronavirus vaccines require two doses, many countries also report the number of people who have received just one dose and the number who have been fully vaccinated.\n\nMany of the charts on this page show the number of people who have received at least one dose of a vaccine, which can offer significant protection against severe disease and reduce the risk of transmission, according to some studies.\n\nIf a country only reports the number of doses they have administered in total, we do not know the number of people who have been vaccinated. Those countries are excluded from our charts and statistics about people vaccinated.",
